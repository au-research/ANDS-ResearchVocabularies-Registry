## Vocabs registry database connection properties.

# Database properties can be specified here instead of/as well as
# in persistence.xml.

# Standard JPA properties
# Replace [path to DB] with something like localhost/vocabs_registry
# The connection parameters for datetime/timezone are important; don't adjust them!
javax.persistence.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://[path to DB]?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&serverTimezone=UTC&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false
javax.persistence.jdbc.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
javax.persistence.jdbc.user=[db_username]
javax.persistence.jdbc.password=[db_password]

# Hibernate-specific settings
# Cope with the database server dropping connections after a timeout.
# This is the most basic setting; customize as per instructions at:
#   http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/
hibernate.c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckout=true
# Future work:
# Add this to the Tomcat JVM command line after c3p0 libraries
# are upgraded to version 0.9.5 or later, then tune the debugging
# so c3p0/MLog logging also goes through LogBack.
#  -Dcom.mchange.v2.log.MLog=com.mchange.v2.log.slf4j.Slf4jMLog
# This is needed (at least with MySQL) to ensure that changes made
# to the database externally (i.e., by the portal) are immediately
# visible to JPA queries.
# The value 2 means TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED.
# For the possible values, see:
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_NONE
# Hmm, let's try without this setting. For the registry database, we won't
# have the portal changing things underneath us.
#hibernate.connection.isolation=2

# Absolutely necessary to force instances of java.sql.Timestamp
# to be sent back and forth to the database using UTC.
# Unfortunately, this is Hibernate-specific; there doesn't
# seem to be a way to do this in "pure" JPA.
# See http://in.relation.to/2016/09/12/jdbc-time-zone-configuration-property/
hibernate.jdbc.time_zone=UTC
