The ICU4J library associated with this version of Solr is version
56.1. In order for the test in the TestLanguageConversion class to
pass, a later version of ICU4J is required. So the ICU4J JAR has been
removed from this directory, and a new version of the JAR has been
included in a separate directory (q.v.).
