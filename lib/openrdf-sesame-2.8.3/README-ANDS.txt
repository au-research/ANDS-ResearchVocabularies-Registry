ANDS note:

The following logging libraries required by this version of Sesame
have been removed, as newer versions of them were required to support
logstash-logback-encoder.

jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.10.jar
logback-classic-1.1.2.jar
logback-core-1.1.2.jar
slf4j-api-1.7.10.jar

The newer versions of these JARs can be found in the logback-* and
slf4j-* subdirectories of the lib directory.
