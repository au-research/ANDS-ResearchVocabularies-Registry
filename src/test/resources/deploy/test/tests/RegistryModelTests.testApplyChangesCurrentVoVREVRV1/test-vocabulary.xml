It organises information about collections and services into a format used by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) Collections Registry. &#xA;&#xA;More information on the RIF-CS Schema can be found at http://ands.org.au/guides/cpguide/cpgrifcs.html. &#xA;&#xA;With assistance from the RIF-CS Advisory Board and user community, ANDS has developed a suggested vocabulary for use with the RIF-CS Schema. The vocabulary is comprised of suggested terms for specific elements of the schema. Use of the ANDS vocabulary with the RIF-CS Schema is not mandatory but is however recommended. Use of consistent terminology improves data discoverability and the precision of search operations. &#xA;&#xA;The ANDS vocabularies are expected to be informed and developed further by the RIF-CS user community. Please contact services@ands.org.au if you have candidate vocabulary terms to be evaluated for possible inclusion in the ANDS vocabularies.
