    "dcterms_description": "<p>\n  This module provides guidelines for undertaking a desktop study and then\n  covers the procedures and guidelines for recording the survey methods, effort\n  and outcomes of targeted surveys and monitoring for species or ecological\n  communities. Targeted surveys do not need to occur at a plot, and where the\n  project or research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey\n  or trap design, or use of methods not applied during plot-based surveys, the\n  Targeted surveys module should be used. Targeted surveys should not be viewed\n  as an alternative to standardised plot-based surveys and should generally be\n  used in addition to plot-based surveys, to obtain further information about\n  species or ecological communities.\n</p>\n<p>The module contains three protocols:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Fauna protocol</strong> – to record survey type, survey effort and\n      any observations of target fauna species or suitable habitat within the\n      project area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Flora protocol</strong> – to record survey effort and any\n      observations of target flora species, populations or suitable habitat\n      within the project area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Ecological community protocol</strong> – to record survey effort\n      and any observations of target ecological communities within the project\n      area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Vertebrate fauna – provides further details on vertebrate fauna survey,\n      collection and vouchering methods. Fauna surveys can trigger the need for\n      targeted surveys if a threatened species is identified at a plot.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Invertebrate fauna – provides further details on invertebrate fauna\n      survey, collection and vouchering methods. Invertebrate fauna surveys can\n      trigger the need for targeted surveys if a threatened or invasive species\n      is identified at a plot.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Opportunistic observations – opportunistic observations of species of\n      interest (e.g. threatened or invasive) may trigger the need for targeted\n      surveys.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Floristics – provides further details on vascular plant collection and\n      vouchering methods.

If a threatened or invasive species\n      is detected at a vegetation mapping point, this may trigger the need for a\n      targeted survey.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Recruitment – the survivorship protocol in the Recruitment module can be\n      used to track survival, growth and life-stages of individual plants\n      overtime, and can be used to monitor target flora species.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Desktop study</strong></p>\n<p>\n  One of the first steps when undertaking a targeted survey should always be to\n  complete a desktop study or review, to gather contextual information on the\n  area and species/community to be surveyed from existing surveys or reports,\n  scientific literature, database searches and spatial information (see\n  Appendices 1 and 2 for resources to assist with desktop studies). Desktop\n  studies can help to plan and undertake field surveys (Environment Protection\n  Authority 2020), and the information collated can be used to make informed\n  decisions on the appropriate level of survey effort, key survey methods and\n  techniques, stratification of the project area and can feed into background\n  information for reporting. Desktop studies should involve a search for all\n  relevant sources of literature, data and map-based information (Freeman et al.\n  2015, Environment Protection Authority 2020), and requires a thorough\n  examination of the literature to identify the best times, locations and\n  techniques for the survey (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚\n  Population and Communities 2011a).\n</p>\n<p>There are a range of sources that can be reviewed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Databases maintained by the Australian Government, including the Species\n      Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database and the Protected Matters Search Tool\n      (see\n      <u>http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/sprat.pl</u> and\n      <u\n        >https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool</u\n      >).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      State and Territory conservation agencies and local government databases\n      and predictive models\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      National and State/Territory threatened species recovery plans and teams\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Reference books, including field identification guides</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Aerial photographs and satellite imagery, topographic maps, vegetation\n      maps, geological maps and soils maps\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Historic records and flora, fauna and vegetation communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Lists of threatened species, populations or ecological communities in the\n      area\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Literature about the ecology of the species, communities and habitats\n      found or likely to be found in the area\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Consultation with local groups, researchers and experts (Department of the\n      Environment 2013b).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  All information used in a desktop study requires an evaluation of its\n  reliability and suitability for the current project, including the source and\n  age of the information, suitability of techniques used, skills and experience\n  of observer/researcher, data analysis and survey timing (DEC 2004, Environment\n  Protection Authority 2020).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When undertaking a desktop assessment, the following can be points can be used\n  as a guide when planning, designing and undertaking surveys:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The number and location of species records, and dates of those records\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The distribution of species, population and ecological communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The location and extent of suitable habitats within the project area</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Current threats to the species or ecological communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended time(s) of year to survey</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended time(s) of day to survey</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Optimal survey conditions (rainfall, wind, temperature etc)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Length of survey (i.e., number of trap nights) and survey effort (number\n      of traps, search area)\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Best practice survey methods</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended equipment and use</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Site access and logistics</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Necessary skills and experience</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Habitat and behaviour (fauna species)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Habitat requirements and phenology (flora species).</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  A key process to undertake when planning a field survey is stratification of\n  the project area. Stratification involves breaking the project area into\n  assessment units that are relatively homogeneous, and these units are then\n  used to determine the location and number of sites that are needed to\n  adequately survey the habitat types present across the project area (Eyre et\n  al. 2018). Vegetation maps, aerial photographs, topographic maps, occurrence\n  records and satellite imagery can be useful for stratification and determining\n  locations for targeted searches (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚\n  Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Habitat preferences of the target species or community should be considered\n  during the site selection process, and it is common for survey effort to be\n  higher in areas of suitable habitat (Environmental Protection Authority\n  2016a). However, targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of\n  occupancy risks misinterpreting true patterns of occurrence, as survey designs\n  that rely heavily on previous knowledge have the risk of becoming\n  self-fulfilling prophecies, as they uncritically reinforce underlying\n  assumptions (Cristescu et al. 2019). In addition, the habitat needs and\n  behaviour of many threatened species are often poorly understood (Department\n  of Environment and Conservation NSW 2004). Consequently, all potentially\n  suitable habitats should be systematically searched for targeted species or\n  ecological communities (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a), and\n  exclusion of habitat should only be to areas where a species or community\n  cannot exist (Cristescu et al. 2019).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Timing of surveys is also an important consideration when planning surveys.\n  Careful consideration of the necessary lead time is required, as it may be\n  necessary to survey at specific times of the year, depending on the ecology of\n  the species in the subject area, or to undertake multiple surveys across the\n  year or across years (Department of the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the\n  Arts 2010b). Many species will vary in detectability between seasons because\n  of behavioural differences or variation in habitat conditions (Department of\n  the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the Arts 2010b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Surveys should be undertaken when the target species and/or communities are\n  most detectable and identifiable in the field, (i.e. for flora, during the\n  relevant flowering/fruiting time for each species) (Environmental Protection\n  Authority 2016a). For areas with multiple significant species, there may not\n  be a single time of the year suitable to detect all species, and in these\n  cases, multiple visits, each targeting different species or groups should be\n  considered (Environment Protection Authority 2020). For example, many cryptic\n  and rare plants are more detectable during flowering or seed set, and the\n  timing of these can vary across the year (NSW National Parks and Wildlife\n  Service and SMEC Australia 2001), while peak invertebrate activity often\n  coincides with rainfall events, which are difficult to predict (EPA 2016b).\n</p>\n<p><strong>Appendices</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Appendix 1.

    "dcterms_description": "<p>\n  The <em>Camera traps</em> module covers three camera trapping protocols that\n  can be undertaken depending on the purpose of your project:\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Fauna plot protocol – standardised deployment of Reconyx 2–5 white flash\n      camera traps and accompanying bait stations in a fauna plot, either in\n      conjunction with a vertebrate fauna survey (recommended) or stand alone.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Array protocol – many camera traps (e.g. 20–30) deployed in a systematic\n      array (e.g. grid, transect) to monitor fauna occupancy and density in the\n      project area (via downstream capture-mark-recapture methods and random\n      encounter models).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Targeted protocol – remote cameras deliberately deployed at features of\n      interest (e.g. suitable habitat, trail intersections, waterpoints, tree\n      hollows, inflorescences) in the project area to maximise fauna detection,\n      supplement species inventory, or record behaviour, with the option to\n      capture video, orientate camera traps horizontally (i.e. downward-facing\n      detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles,\n      and use bait stations or lures.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The module covers pre-field survey tasks, including study design\n  considerations and remote camera preparation to maximise species detection and\n  identification whilst minimising false triggers, as well as post-field survey\n  tasks, including data storage, processing, and analysis.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Fauna plot</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for\n  the standardised deployment and recovery or redeployment of camera traps in a\n  fauna plot, including standards for camera make, model and settings, camera\n  placement and orientation, site preparation, bait station installation,\n  deployment period, and entering the data directly into the App. The protocol\n  is based on the standard operating procedure for camera trapping developed by\n  the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap guidelines\n  (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both standardised methodologies were developed\n  from extensive trialing of various camera trap survey designs and consultation\n  with a range of expert practitioners, to optimise the effectiveness and\n  consistency of camera traps for general vertebrate fauna surveys and\n  monitoring. For a standardised protocol that covers the effective and\n  consistent use and deployment of remote cameras as part of general vertebrate\n  biodiversity surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), the fauna plot protocol\n  is the best approach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Array</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for\n  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps in an array within the\n  project area, including locating camera trap points in an evenly spaced grid\n  or at regular intervals along a transect, and then micrositing the exact\n  camera trap point locations within the grid or transect to optimise fauna\n  detections, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model\n  and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target\n  species if applicable, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly\n  into the App. The protocol has been developed based on the Terrestrial\n  Vertebrate (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol (TEAM Network 2011b).\n  This protocol was developed from the collective experience of many field\n  biologists with experience using camera trap arrays to estimate the abundance\n  of a range of terrestrial mammal and bird species. The sampling design was\n  carefully specified to maximise the probability of detecting an adequate\n  sample of terrestrial mammal and bird species. It was intended to monitor\n  changes in the community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates, but not\n  to monitor the abundance of individuals species. The sampling design\n  compromised between detecting species that range over large areas (&gt;100\n  km<sup>2</sup>) and those with smaller home ranges (~1 km<sup>2</sup>). The\n  camera trap array protocol outlined here differs in that it allows the\n  flexibility to monitor the community or individual species. Surveyors can\n  select the density and number of camera traps, and the deployment period based\n  on the aims of their project, with this information recorded in a standarised\n  manner among projects using the App.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you wish to undertake a general survey of the fauna across a project or\n  study area without altering the behaviour of that fauna, the\n  <em>Array</em> protocol is the most effective approach. As this protocol can\n  be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and uniformly it provides a\n  better sample size than the other protocols, thereby enabling a more accurate\n  indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this reason,\n  an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a camera trap\n  array sample is more likely to reflect a true absence (where a species is not\n  present) than the other protocols. If resources are limited, establishing a\n  transect through the most representative part of the survey area and placing\n  camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be the\n  best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect samples\n  cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is possible to\n  combine grid and transect approaches (Molloy 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Targeted</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the\n  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps at features of interest\n  within the project area, including identifying features of interest, micro\n  siting the exact camera trap point locations to optimize fauna detections,\n  installing bait stations, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap\n  make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point,\n  target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a\n  standardized manner directly into the App. The targeted protocol may be used\n  in combination with the fauna plot protocol to supplement species inventory\n  when undertaking fauna monitoring within a project area. The targeted protocol\n  has been included in recognition that deliberately biased placement of camera\n  traps at features of interest are a commonly used camera trapping sampling\n  strategy (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Targeted camera trapping can also be\n  undertaken as part of the <em>Targeted surveys</em> module and can be used in\n  combination with a range of other targeted methods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are monitoring the behaviour of fauna under a certain set of\n  conditions, sampling fauna at a specific set of points for experimental\n  purposes (e.g., to examine responses of fauna to differing vegetation or\n  specific landscape parameters), or monitoring fauna at a place of activity or\n  gathering point such as a trail intersection, water point or nest site, the\n  <em>Targeted</em> protocol is the most effective approach. This protocol\n  allows researchers and practitioners to monitor a large area with minimal\n  resources and to answer specific research questions. However, this approach is\n  highly susceptible to bias and provides a limited insight into the ecology of\n  the greater landscape as a whole (Molloy 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The data standards for all three protocols are based on the\n  <em>Camera Trap Metadata Standard</em> developed by Forrester\n  <em>et al.</em> (2016), an open data standard for storing and sharing camera\n  trap data. The standard captures information necessary to share data between\n  projects and offers a foundation for collecting the more detailed data needed\n  for downstream analyses. The standard captures information about study design,\n  the type of camera trap used, and the location and species names for all\n  detections, among others, in a standardized manner. The standard is compatible\n  with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Darwin Core, the Ecological\n  Metadata Language, and the Audubon Core metadata standards to allow data to be\n  easily cross referenced with existing data repositories, such as DataONE\n  (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 2016).\n</p>\n<p>The <em>Camera traps</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Plot selection and layout</em> – the fauna plot protocol requires a\n      fauna plot to be selected, established and laid out.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> – Fauna habitats in the project area and fauna\n      plot selection can be informed by the results of the\n      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Vertebrate fauna</em> – camera traps can be used in combination with a\n      range of other vertebrate fauna survey methods (e.g. pitfall trapping).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Targeted surveys</em> – camera traps can be recorded as part of\n      targeted surveys and can be used in combination with a range of other\n      targeted measures.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Interventions</em> – camera traps can be used to detect distribution\n      and population trends associated with interventions to conserve threatened\n      species, as well as monitor vertebrate pest population control.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pre-field survey tasks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">\n  <strong>Study design and planning considerations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  For many camera trapping applications, such as surveying the distribution of\n  species, estimating species abundance, or monitoring changes in these\n  parameters through time, proper attention must be given to the study design,\n  the make and model of the camera trap used, camera trap deployment, and what\n  data is collected and how it will be analysed. Poorly designed surveys often\n  result in data which cannot be used to answer the question of interest\n  (Gillespie et al. 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  A clear and defined statement of the study objectives and why camera traps are\n  the best survey tool to achieve these objectives is an important component of\n  camera trapping studies, which can range from investigations of behaviour,\n  species inventory and assessing abundance, as well as exploratory, where the\n  data produced (e.g. an image of a new species, or a range extension for an\n  existing species) provides important information to address particular\n  scientific or management questions. The study design and methodology should\n  align with the clearly defined objectives (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  This section includes two decision keys (Figure 1 and Figure 2) to ensure the\n  appropriate use of camera traps and the three camera trapping protocols, as\n  well as design and planning considerations for detection, camera trap make and\n  model, the number and density of camera traps in an array, deployment period,\n  the target species, use of attractants, and permits and ethics.\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Camera trap decision keys</p>\n<p>\n  The following two decision keys will help you determine whether or not camera\n  traps are suitable to use and which protocol is recommended, based on the\n  objectives of your survey, the available resources and the target species\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Start with Decision Key 1 (Figure 1).

Camera trap surveys, which sample mobile species,\n  must consider imperfect detection at the camera trap scale, where fauna\n  passing through the relatively small camera trap detection zone fail to be\n  detected, and at the study area scale, where fauna using the study area that\n  the camera trap is assumed to sample fail to be detected (Figure) (Burton\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The probability of detection (i.e. the probability that a species will be\n  detected during a survey if it is present within the study area; Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015) is affected by several factors at the camera trap scale,\n  including camera trap specifications, deployment mode, animal body size and\n  temperature, animal movement speed, behaviour and group size, ambient\n  temperature and light, and vegetation and other obstructions, and at the study\n  area scale, including animal density and movement, the size and selection of\n  sampling units, the number and location of camera traps, the use of\n  attractant, the deployment period, and analytical assumptions (Burton\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Consideration of these factors (see below) and\n  following the carefully planned camera trapping protocols are imperative to\n  reduce detection bias in camera trap field data collection. However,\n  researchers will need to consider analytical approaches to contend with\n  imperfect detection when undertaking downstream analyses (e.g.\n  capture-mark-recapture methods, random encounter models).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Figure.

There are numerous manufacturers (e.g. Reconyx,\n  Pixcontroller, Buckeye, Cuddeback, Bushnell, Scoutguard) that typically have\n  multiple camera trap models available to researchers and practitioners. These\n  makes and models vary in their trigger speed, detection zone, sensor\n  sensitivity, how they detect fauna (e.g. PIR or AIR sensors) and how they\n  illuminate the scene at night (e.g. white or infrared flash), among others\n  (Table 2). Websites such as TrailCamPro.com provide comparative performance\n  statistics as well specifications for many popular models (Meek\n  <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The camera trap features that should be evaluated when\n  selecting a camera trap model are summarised in Table 2. Only a single model\n  of camera trap should be used in a study because performance is likely to vary\n  among models.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Recording the make and model (including the manufacturing year for models that\n  are updated frequently but keep the same name) of the camera traps used in a\n  study ensures repeatability of the methods and comparability of the results,\n  both among projects and monitoring surveys within the same project. Data of\n  the remaining camera trap features summarised in Table 2 should also be\n  collected with the camera trap make, model and year as these features are not\n  always apparent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Choosing the right tool for the job is common sense, but there are many\n  examples where a poor choice of camera trap negatively affects the outcome.\n  For example, images captured with infrared flash are monochrome and of\n  relatively low resolution compared to those taken with a white light flash.\n  Remote cameras with infrared flash are therefore not well suited to surveys of\n  species that may be difficult to identify accurately from poor-quality images,\n  such as many small mammal species. The possibility that the species of\n  interest might be disturbed by a white light flash or the noises made by\n  cameras and subsequently avoid the camera is also an important consideration\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, studies of animal use (e.g.\n  burrows, tree hollows) may be better carried out using camera traps with an\n  AIR sensor, rather than a PIR sensor, and choosing a camera trap with a small\n  detection zone and a slow trigger response may be unsuccessful in detecting\n  small and fast-moving animals at close range (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Reconyx Hyperfire camera traps are the most widely used camera trap for\n  wildlife research (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012; Meek <em>et al.</em> 2015; Meek\n  2018). Protocols that specify the use of Reconyx camera traps in Australia\n  include the standard operating procedure for camera trapping in northern\n  Australia developed by the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap\n  guidelines (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both of these protocols use Reconyx\n  HC550 or PC850 camera for data consistency and comparability. These models\n  have similar specifications and setting options, as well as LED white flash\n  capability, which importantly allows colour images to be captured during the\n  day and night, and significantly improves species identification capability\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Internationally, the Terrestrial Vertebrate\n  (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol requires the use of Reconyx camera\n  traps, particularly the HC500 or PC800 models, depending on the site’s climate\n  (PC800 models used in humid climates). This is due to their rapid response\n  time, infrared flash, multi-fire capabilities and unique design for field\n  conditions (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Table.

When ambient temperature falls within the body\n        temperature range of most mammals (31.5–36.5° C), PIR camera traps can\n        be unreliable. PIR sensors can also be triggered by the movement of\n        pockets of hot air or by the motion of warm vegetation in the detection\n        zone. This problem can be limited by avoiding pointing the camera trap\n        directly to a background that is under sun incidence. Active infrared\n        (AIR) sensors, which respond to a break in an infrared beam between two\n        units spaced apart, are not widely used but may, for example, be\n        suitable for studies of animal use of burrows or tree hollows.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Trigger speed</td>\n      <td>\n        A fundamental feature of camera traps, if not the critical feature.

This is fundamental in\n        studies that require individual recognition or for faunal inventories,\n        as colour images improve species identification. Currently, classic\n        Xenon white flashes produce sharper images than white LED flashes due to\n        their greater power and flash duration that is short enough to freeze\n        moving animals. Camera traps with infrared flash use arrays of LEDs that\n        emit infrared light, mostly in the range of 700–1000 nm. The images\n        captured are often in grey-scale or may have a reddish-pink tinge.\n        Infrared flashes tend to be less obvious to fauna, use less energy and\n        tend to have quicker trigger speeds than white flashes. Recently,\n        no-glow (also called “black”) infrared flashes have been introduced to\n        minimise the red glow emitted by standard infrared LEDs which is seen by\n        animals. A limited number of PIR camera trap models (e.g. Spypoint,\n        Bolymedia) have dual flashes (Xenon and infrared).\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Detection zone</td>\n      <td>\n        Critical feature that varies widely among current models (15.8–324.1 m;\n        Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone\n        (i.e. smaller than the field of view) usually have fast trigger speeds\n        and will take the photo when the animal is well within the field of\n        view. The detection zone can be increased to some extent by moving the\n        camera trap further away from the target, which can compensate for slow\n        trigger speeds.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Number of photos taken, recovery time, and video</td>\n      <td>\n        Capability to capture bursts of images in rapid sequence (i.e. fast\n        recovery time) may be important for improved species identification (as\n        chances of obtaining a good image within a burst will be increased),\n        recording individuals within family groups and packs, and analysis of\n        passing sequences to derive day range, which is a critical parameter in\n        the Random Encounter Model (REM; Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). At\n        night, Xenon white flash cameras are not capable to take photo bursts or\n        videos due to the recharge time of flash that can take ≥ 30 seconds, a\n        limitation that is overcome by LED white flash camera traps. Rapid image\n        sequences and video can be useful for behavioural studies or specific\n        research needs. However, data handling is more time consuming, SD cards\n        are filled quicker and power consumption is greater, hence videos are\n        not recommended when photographs alone provide the data required.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>PIR sensitivity</td>\n      <td>\n        Regulates the sensor responsiveness to the target by changing the heat\n        sensitivity threshold.

The three most common\n        battery types used by camera traps are AA Lithium, Nickel Metal Hydride\n        (NiMH) and Alkaline, which are discussed in the Batteries section.\n        Despite the higher initial costs, rechargeable NiMH batteries are\n        recommended as long as camera trap performances are not altered.

The option of programming the operation time, to avoid\n        unnecessary images, may be useful for example when only nocturnal\n        species are targeted. Setting camera traps to take an image at regular\n        intervals in time (i.e. time lapse), either at pre-designated intervals\n        or regular intervals following a motion detection, may be useful to\n        decrease data load while confirming presence or examine temporal\n        activity of invertebrates (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011; Potter\n        <em>et al.</em> 2021).\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Target species</p>\n<p>\n  The target species, suites of species, or community of interest should be\n  clearly identified when planning camera trap surveys. This is because the\n  study design, camera trap model, camera trap point selection, mode of\n  deployment, deployment period and type and variety of lure, if used, should be\n  tailored to the target fauna to maximise detection probability (Harmsen\n  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2013; Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016;\n  Fancourt <em>et al.</em> 2018; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a), with\n  consideration of their size, behaviour and mode of body temperature\n  regulation. For example, to maximise numbat (500–700 g mammal) detection,\n  Swift 3C wide-angle camera traps set 25 cm above the ground are recommended as\n  they recorded 89% of known events, compared to Swift 3C standard (51%) and\n  Reconyx PC900 camera traps (37%). Furthermore, camera traps mounted at 2 m\n  above the ground and angled towards the ground resulted in significantly more\n  identifications of individual numbats than those mounted at 1 m and 1.25 m\n  (Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020). If using camera traps to survey small\n  mammals, models with white flash will likely be required to capture the\n  characteristic features required to distinguish similar-looking sympatric\n  species with an acceptable level of precision (Meek and Vernes 2015). Video\n  has also been crucial to distinguish two antechinus species, with their\n  behaviour and movements being particularly diagnostic (Gray\n  <em>et al.</em> 2017).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Tracks and roads have been shown to facilitate movement of introduced\n  predators such as feral cats and foxes (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2012), and\n  consequently, placing camera traps along them will increase the probability of\n  detection (Meek 2018). Indeed, on-road detectability using camera traps was\n  estimated to be seven times higher for cats and three times higher for foxes\n  than off-road detectability. Furthermore, targeting camera trap survey effort\n  on-road yielded the greatest power for detecting declines in both species\n  (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), which is useful for monitoring the success of\n  lethal baiting programs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The majority of camera traps work by sensing objects that move and are a\n  different temperature relative to the background surface and objects. They are\n  therefore most suited to detecting mammals and to a lesser extent birds (i.e.\n  endotherms; TEAM Network 2011b; Cloyed <em>et al.</em> 2018), but are\n  generally less sensitive at detecting reptiles and amphibians (i.e.\n  ectotherms; Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, camera traps positioned\n  facing downwards have successfully monitored reptiles using bait stations to\n  attract species to the detection zone, drift fences to direct species towards\n  the detection zone, and cork tiles to create a sufficient thermal contrast\n  between the tile, which is heated by the sun, and the species (Welbourne\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a). More recently, this\n  approach was refined by reducing the focal length of Reconxy camera traps to\n  avoid blurry images of when placing them facing downwards, 70 cm above the\n  ground, This allowed small, similar looking sympatric species to be\n  differentiated (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2019). Reconyx can alter the focal\n  length of their professional series of camera traps at the time of purchase,\n  but it is also possible for practitioners to adjust this themselves, as\n  demonstrated by Welbourne <em>et al.</em> (2019).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For amphibians, camera traps set to capture time lapse images, or a\n  combination of sensor triggered and time lapse images have been successfully\n  used to monitor movements (Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011), and describe\n  activity patterns and behaviour (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2010; Engbrecht and\n  Lannoo 2012), including for a rare and elusive micro-endemic frog species\n  strictly dependent on bromeliads (Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ultimately, the target animals influence several",

    "dcterms_description": "<p>\n  The Invertebrate fauna module covers the procedures and guidelines for the\n  field capture and preservation of terrestrial invertebrate fauna. This module\n  is undertaken within fauna monitoring plots, adjacent to the vegetation and\n  soil plots. Figure 1 shows the layout for the protocols that are undertaken at\n  fixed locations within the plot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The module offers nine sampling protocols, targeting different invertebrate\n  groups, as summarised in Table 2. The survey design and equipment for each\n  protocol is standardised to ensure comparability of the results across\n  projects. Where applicable, the protocols follow existing, established\n  protocols and draw on current research. Users determine which of the nine\n  protocols should be undertaken for their project needs; at a minimum the\n  Active search and Micro-pitfall trapping protocols are undertaken at the start\n  of a project, and Micro-pitfall trapping is repeated for monitoring.\n  Implementing a range of complementary sampling protocols is strongly\n  recommended, especially at the start of a project, to provide a baseline for\n  inventory and monitoring. A post-field protocol covers the requirements for\n  sample curation relevant to all protocols.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The need to undertake the Invertebrate fauna module and, subsequently, the\n  selection of sampling protocols is determined at the start of a project\n  depending on the project objectives and their suitability for the situation.\n  The results and project objectives should also inform which protocols to\n  repeat, and how often. Repeat sampling using a range of methods increases the\n  ability to detect different indicator species/functional groups, and therefore\n  monitor trends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The protocols are ideally undertaken at the same time as the vertebrate fauna\n  and vegetation and soil monitoring (with consideration given to season). The\n  number of plots that require sampling will be determined at the start of the\n  project (see Introduction Chapter). The repeat survey interval will depend on\n  the project and the protocol. For comparability of the data, repeat surveys\n  should be undertaken at the same time(s) of year, moon phase and during\n  similar weather conditions. If the conditions are unsuitable, the sampling\n  period is rescheduled or if this is not possible, any deviations in the\n  sampling conditions are recorded.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All invertebrate catch is preserved (for each trap and each trapping period)\n  and stored for future analysis, generally as bulk, mixed samples (reflecting\n  how they were collected in the field) until identification is required,\n  available or affordable. Samples can be sorted (e.g. into RTU’s and\n  life-stages). Specimen identification and DNA analysis will require expert\n  input. The Invertebrate fauna module is linked to the following modules:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Plot selection and layout – before commencing the Invertebrate fauna\n      module, the Plot selection and layout module must be completed to mark out\n      the fauna plot with high accuracy using the Trimble® R1.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Soils – the soil samples collected for the Soils module provide the\n      opportunity to detect invertebrate fauna through eDNA.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Vertebrate fauna – invertebrates may be opportunistically collected in\n      vertebrate fauna traps. The selection of vertebrate fauna protocols (full\n      or lite) may dictate the selection of micro-pitfall trapping protocol\n      (full or lite). The timing of invertebrate sampling will need to consider\n      any impacts on vertebrate fauna trapping (e.g. light trapping could\n      influence vertebrate fauna trap results).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Targeted survey – the results of the Invertebrate fauna module sampling\n      may be a trigger for targeted survey. If biosecurity (i.e. monitoring for\n      potential incursion of exotic pests) is a specific focus, sampling methods\n      outside of those listed in the Invertebrate fauna module may be more\n      appropriate to enable rapid detection of taxa – use the Targeted Survey\n      module in such instances.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Opportune – invertebrates can also be collected opportunistically (within\n      and outside the plot) as part of the Opportunistic observations module.\n      The opportunity for opportunistic sampling of invertebrates may occur\n      during systematic sampling. The Opportunistic observations module can be\n      quick-accessed from within the Invertebrate fauna module to record such\n      records.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The invertebrate sampling results can be analysed in relation to attribute\n  data collected in the adjoining vegetation plot. For example, the abundance of\n  invertebrate captures could be analysed in relation to: plant type, plant\n  cover and phenology collected as part of the Cover and Floristics modules;\n  leaf litter cover collected as part of the Cover module; soil type and bulk\n  density collected as part of the Soils module; coarse woody debris size and\n  availability collected as part of the Coarse Woody Debris module; and soil\n  char depth collected as part of the Fire module.\n</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>\n    <p>Table 2.

A\n      pre-requisite when establishing the fauna plot is that the vegetation\n      association is homogeneous and matches that within the adjoining\n      vegetation and soils plot.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For baseline inventory, plots are chosen to cover the major vegetation\n      associations present within a project area, providing spatial coverage\n      across the project area, and focusing on areas that represent the most\n      natural (undisturbed) conditions. For ongoing monitoring, plot selection\n      will depend on the question/s being asked and the impact footprint, and\n      may include a range of conditions and treatments (e.g. design) (Hoekman et\n      al. 2017).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Terrestrial invertebrate communities that are dependent on or restricted\n      to specific vegetation or habitat types (e.g. SREs) are likely to be most\n      impacted by ecosystem change (Houghton et al. 2019). Ecotones (i.e. where\n      ecosystems converge) and riparian zones are productive areas for\n      collecting invertebrates (Upton et al. 2010), but are not covered by the\n      plot based approach. For these reasons, targeted (outside of plot)\n      invertebrate survey may be important to supplement the plot-based results.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Permits</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      There are no specific permit requirements for collecting terrestrial\n      invertebrates in Australia, unless they are a listed species at a state or\n      Commonwealth level. A scientific permit is required if undertaking work in\n      a protected area. Special permit requirements may apply on offshore\n      islands (e.g. Lord Howe Island, Christmas Island and Macquarie Island)\n      because of their natural heritage value. Permits may also be required if\n      the sampling method poses a risk to vertebrate fauna. Refer to the\n      relevant authority in the relevant State or Territory (Upton et al. 2010).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The survey coordinator must check that all scientific permit and animal\n      ethics requirements are being met. Refer to the Introduction chapter.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Equipment</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The protocols require the use of the Mobile App and the Trimble® R1. For\n      instructions on how to operate the Trimble® R1 refer to the General\n      Introduction Chapter. The guidelines below are relevant to all\n      invertebrate fauna protocols.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The specific invertebrate collecting equipment identified in this module\n      must be used to standardise the results. Most of the equipment can be\n      sourced from Australian Entomological Supplies (online). The relevant\n      state/local environmental authority may have equipment available for hire.\n      Refer to each of the protocols below for a list of the equipment required.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Trimble® R1 is the preferred method for recording the location of\n      invertebrate sampling, as this provides a high level of accuracy that is\n      important for repeat monitoring.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      DAWE and TERN have no affiliation with any of the suppliers listed. Where\n      a specific supplier is noted, this is simply for convenience, and\n      alternatives can be sourced. For a list of entomological suppliers, refer\n      to (Upton et al. 2010) (p75).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The permit conditions in some jurisdictions require fauna survey equipment\n      that is used to capture animals to be clearly labelled (e.g., organisation\n      name, contact number and/or permit number). Check your permit conditions\n      for any details that may be required.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      It is important to clean equipment thoroughly when collecting samples for\n      DNA analysis.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Traps/survey equipment must be removed at the completion of a survey\n      event.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Safety</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Users should avoid working in the field alone and should carry portable\n      communication devices (mobiles, UHF radios), especially when working in\n      remote areas.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Chemicals are used for killing and preserving invertebrates, notably ethyl\n      acetate, ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and propylene glycol.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Ethanol and ethyl acetate are highly flammable (both in liquid and vapour\n      form). Ethanol is a mild poison (made by distillation with benzene which\n      causes cancer, not suitability for human consumption). Breathing vapours\n      of ethyl acetate may cause drowsiness and dizziness, and irritate the\n      eyes, throat and skin. Repeated contact causes defatting of the skin with\n      irritation, dryness, and cracking, and can be seriously damaging to\n      internal organs in the case of prolonged exposure.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Propylene glycol (antifreeze) is generally regarded as safe (not suitable\n      for human consumption but environmentally non-toxic). It can be safely\n      disposed of on soil or in water, although check the disposal requirements\n      as they may vary between jurisdictions. Do not use ethylene glycol\n      antifreeze as it is poisonous, toxic and requires disposal at a licenced\n      facility.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      MSDS must be printed and stored with any chemicals, and strict safety\n      protocols followed. Permits may be required regarding their use and\n      transport.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weather</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The suitability of the weather conditions for the invertebrate sampling\n      methods should be assessed prior to a field trip. Adjustments may be\n      necessary to the trip dates or survey days within the trip.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If possible, an onsite automatic weather station should be installed for\n      the duration of a sampling event, to record daily temperatures, rainfall\n      and humidity. A weather station is established as part of the Vertebrate\n      fauna module (full protocol). For invertebrate survey, the weather station\n      is ideally placed near the ground surface within the fauna plot.\n      Otherwise, data should be obtained from the nearest weather station.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Categorical weather data (drop-down selections for wind, rain,\n      temperature, sun/cloud) is also recorded for each protocol. The data\n      fields will be pre-filled if weather data has already been recorded for\n      the day, with the option to update the entries to match the prevailing\n      conditions.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sampling, preservation, identification and storage</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      It is helpful to be familiar with the common invertebrate orders before\n      conducting surveys. There are a number of useful web resources available,\n      such as:\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>http://anic.ento.csiro.au/insectfamilies/</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/bugwise/</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        A list of useful books and identification keys is provided in Upton et\n        al. (2010).\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Experience visually identifying invertebrates in the field is not\n      essential for this module as all captures are collected for later\n      identification, either based on morphology or via DNA analysis. This means\n      it is of utmost importance that the samples are appropriately stored.\n      Preservation and storage requirements are summarized in Section 10.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Liaise with the receiving museum or relevant institution prior to\n      commencing this module, to discuss:\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>specific collection, preservation and storage requirements</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        the availability and cost of taxonomic identification and genetic\n        expertise\n      </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>options for long-term storage.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Ethyl acetate is used as standard euthanising chemical in the field, for\n      active survey methods or where specimens are dry collected. For\n      instructions on how to make a kill jar, refer to Upton et al. (2010).\n      Freezing is the most humane method of killing insects if this option is\n      available. Some taxa (e.g. moths and butterflies) are best kept alive and\n      put in a freezer as soon as practical after trapping to preserve their\n      condition (Sherley and Evans 2016).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Appropriate preservation and storage of samples is of utmost importance to\n      ensure their future value. High grade (95% and above) ethanol and\n      undiluted propylene glycol are adopted as the standard preservative\n      solutions, for a killing agent through to long-term storage, based on\n      their DNA preservability, low toxicity, availability and cost (Nakamura et\n      al. 2020). Ethanol is the traditional killing agent of choice however\n      ppropylene glycol has the benefit of being less likely to evaporate in the\n      field, less flammable, odourless, cheaper, and easier to transport.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>RNAlater® is another preservative option that can be explored.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Trapping results can differ significant depending on the killing agent\n      used (Gossner et al. 2016). The relative influence of the preservatives on\n      captures is unknown, however the potential for related bias is true for\n      any preservative that is used (Skvarla et al. 2014). Given propylene\n      glycol is odourless it may be a better option as a killing agent in traps,\n      however this remains untested.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Samples should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight and heat in the field\n      as they can degrade, ethanol can evaporate, and propylene glycol can\n      decompose into water, acetone and isopropanol. The effects generally lead\n      to lower DNA integrity (Weigand et al. 2021). Samples can be kept in a\n      cooler or refrigerator if available.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Timing</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The timing of repeat invertebrate surveys should be standardised as much\n      as possible to reduce the effect of environmental factors and seasonal\n      variability on the results. Ideally, sampling is undertaken during the\n      same time period, the same moon phase, and the same (as much as possible)\n      weather conditions, for the same duration each sampling event.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Invertebrate sampling is ideally undertaken during the same period as\n      vertebrate fauna surveys, so trends can be assessed, and co-timed with the\n      vegetation and soil monitoring, so the results can be analysed with\n      respect to available plant and litter resources in the local landscape.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Timing of surveys for conservation significant and short range endemic\n      invertebrate fauna should follow also follow existing guidelines (EPA\n      2016; Australian Government Department of Agriculture Water and the\n      Environment 2021).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The time of day can be important. Early mornings can be productive as\n      insects are actively feeding as the day warms up. Insect activity\n      typically declines in hot weather (Upton et al. 2010).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Invertebrates can respond to change quicker than plants and animals, and\n      their presence and movements strongly linked to phenological events, so\n      intra-annual sampling covering a range of temporal and meteorological\n      conditions will provide more comprehensive results (Battelle 2020; Grange\n      et al. 2021).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Analysis</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The approach and expertise required to statistically analyse collected\n      data and interpret DNA analyses should be determined at the start of a\n      project and factored into the costs.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reporting</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Reporting on the survey results may be a requirement of scientific permits\n      and animal ethics approval.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Any vertebrate fauna by-catch/trap deaths must be documented.
