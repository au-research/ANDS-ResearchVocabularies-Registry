[{"dcterms_description":"<p>\n  This module provides guidelines for undertaking a desktop study and then\n  covers the procedures and guidelines for recording the survey methods, effort\n  and outcomes of targeted surveys and monitoring for species or ecological\n  communities. Targeted surveys do not need to occur at a plot, and where the\n  project or research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey\n  or trap design, or use of methods not applied during plot-based surveys, the\n  Targeted surveys module should be used. Targeted surveys should not be viewed\n  as an alternative to standardised plot-based surveys and should generally be\n  used in addition to plot-based surveys, to obtain further information about\n  species or ecological communities.\n</p>\n<p>The module contains three protocols:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Fauna protocol</strong> – to record survey type, survey effort and\n      any observations of target fauna species or suitable habitat within the\n      project area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Flora protocol</strong> – to record survey effort and any\n      observations of target flora species, populations or suitable habitat\n      within the project area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Ecological community protocol</strong> – to record survey effort\n      and any observations of target ecological communities within the project\n      area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Vertebrate fauna – provides further details on vertebrate fauna survey,\n      collection and vouchering methods.

Desktop\n  studies can help to plan and undertake field surveys (Environment Protection\n  Authority 2020), and the information collated can be used to make informed\n  decisions on the appropriate level of survey effort, key survey methods and\n  techniques, stratification of the project area and can feed into background\n  information for reporting. Desktop studies should involve a search for all\n  relevant sources of literature, data and map-based information (Freeman et al.\n  2015, Environment Protection Authority 2020), and requires a thorough\n  examination of the literature to identify the best times, locations and\n  techniques for the survey (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚\n  Population and Communities 2011a).\n</p>\n<p>There are a range of sources that can be reviewed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Databases maintained by the Australian Government, including the Species\n      Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database and the Protected Matters Search Tool\n      (see\n      <u>http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/sprat.pl</u> and\n      <u\n        >https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool</u\n      >).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      State and Territory conservation agencies and local government databases\n      and predictive models\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      National and State/Territory threatened species recovery plans and teams\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Reference books, including field identification guides</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Aerial photographs and satellite imagery, topographic maps, vegetation\n      maps, geological maps and soils maps\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Historic records and flora, fauna and vegetation communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Lists of threatened species, populations or ecological communities in the\n      area\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Literature about the ecology of the species, communities and habitats\n      found or likely to be found in the area\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Consultation with local groups, researchers and experts (Department of the\n      Environment 2013b).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  All information used in a desktop study requires an evaluation of its\n  reliability and suitability for the current project, including the source and\n  age of the information, suitability of techniques used, skills and experience\n  of observer/researcher, data analysis and survey timing (DEC 2004, Environment\n  Protection Authority 2020).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When undertaking a desktop assessment, the following can be points can be used\n  as a guide when planning, designing and undertaking surveys:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The number and location of species records, and dates of those records\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The distribution of species, population and ecological communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The location and extent of suitable habitats within the project area</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Current threats to the species or ecological communities</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended time(s) of year to survey</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended time(s) of day to survey</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Optimal survey conditions (rainfall, wind, temperature etc)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Length of survey (i.e., number of trap nights) and survey effort (number\n      of traps, search area)\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Best practice survey methods</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Recommended equipment and use</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Site access and logistics</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Necessary skills and experience</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Habitat and behaviour (fauna species)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Habitat requirements and phenology (flora species).</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  A key process to undertake when planning a field survey is stratification of\n  the project area. Stratification involves breaking the project area into\n  assessment units that are relatively homogeneous, and these units are then\n  used to determine the location and number of sites that are needed to\n  adequately survey the habitat types present across the project area (Eyre et\n  al. 2018). Vegetation maps, aerial photographs, topographic maps, occurrence\n  records and satellite imagery can be useful for stratification and determining\n  locations for targeted searches (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚\n  Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Habitat preferences of the target species or community should be considered\n  during the site selection process, and it is common for survey effort to be\n  higher in areas of suitable habitat (Environmental Protection Authority\n  2016a). However, targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of\n  occupancy risks misinterpreting true patterns of occurrence, as survey designs\n  that rely heavily on previous knowledge have the risk of becoming\n  self-fulfilling prophecies, as they uncritically reinforce underlying\n  assumptions (Cristescu et al. 2019). In addition, the habitat needs and\n  behaviour of many threatened species are often poorly understood (Department\n  of Environment and Conservation NSW 2004). Consequently, all potentially\n  suitable habitats should be systematically searched for targeted species or\n  ecological communities (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a), and\n  exclusion of habitat should only be to areas where a species or community\n  cannot exist (Cristescu et al. 2019).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Timing of surveys is also an important consideration when planning surveys.\n  Careful consideration of the necessary lead time is required, as it may be\n  necessary to survey at specific times of the year, depending on the ecology of\n  the species in the subject area, or to undertake multiple surveys across the\n  year or across years (Department of the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the\n  Arts 2010b). Many species will vary in detectability between seasons because\n  of behavioural differences or variation in habitat conditions (Department of\n  the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the Arts 2010b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Surveys should be undertaken when the target species and/or communities are\n  most detectable and identifiable in the field, (i.e. for flora, during the\n  relevant flowering/fruiting time for each species) (Environmental Protection\n  Authority 2016a). For areas with multiple significant species, there may not\n  be a single time of the year suitable to detect all species, and in these\n  cases, multiple visits, each targeting different species or groups should be\n  considered (Environment Protection Authority 2020). For example, many cryptic\n  and rare plants are more detectable during flowering or seed set, and the\n  timing of these can vary across the year (NSW National Parks and Wildlife\n  Service and SMEC Australia 2001), while peak invertebrate activity often\n  coincides with rainfall events, which are difficult to predict (EPA 2016b).\n</p>\n<p><strong>Appendices</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Appendix 1.

module covers three camera trapping protocols that\n  can be undertaken depending on the purpose of your project:\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Fauna plot protocol – standardised deployment of Reconyx 2–5 white flash\n      camera traps and accompanying bait stations in a fauna plot, either in\n      conjunction with a vertebrate fauna survey (recommended) or stand alone.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Array protocol – many camera traps (e.g. 20–30) deployed in a systematic\n      array (e.g. grid, transect) to monitor fauna occupancy and density in the\n      project area (via downstream capture-mark-recapture methods and random\n      encounter models).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Targeted protocol – remote cameras deliberately deployed at features of\n      interest (e.g. suitable habitat, trail intersections, waterpoints, tree\n      hollows, inflorescences) in the project area to maximise fauna detection,\n      supplement species inventory, or record behaviour, with the option to\n      capture video, orientate camera traps horizontally (i.e. downward-facing\n      detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles,\n      and use bait stations or lures.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The module covers pre-field survey tasks, including study design\n  considerations and remote camera preparation to maximise species detection and\n  identification whilst minimising false triggers, as well as post-field survey\n  tasks, including data storage, processing, and analysis.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Fauna plot</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for\n  the standardised deployment and recovery or redeployment of camera traps in a\n  fauna plot, including standards for camera make, model and settings, camera\n  placement and orientation, site preparation, bait station installation,\n  deployment period, and entering the data directly into the App. The protocol\n  is based on the standard operating procedure for camera trapping developed by\n  the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap guidelines\n  (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both standardised methodologies were developed\n  from extensive trialing of various camera trap survey designs and consultation\n  with a range of expert practitioners, to optimise the effectiveness and\n  consistency of camera traps for general vertebrate fauna surveys and\n  monitoring. For a standardised protocol that covers the effective and\n  consistent use and deployment of remote cameras as part of general vertebrate\n  biodiversity surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), the fauna plot protocol\n  is the best approach.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Array</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for\n  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps in an array within the\n  project area, including locating camera trap points in an evenly spaced grid\n  or at regular intervals along a transect, and then micrositing the exact\n  camera trap point locations within the grid or transect to optimise fauna\n  detections, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model\n  and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target\n  species if applicable, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly\n  into the App. The protocol has been developed based on the Terrestrial\n  Vertebrate (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol (TEAM Network 2011b).\n  This protocol was developed from the collective experience of many field\n  biologists with experience using camera trap arrays to estimate the abundance\n  of a range of terrestrial mammal and bird species. The sampling design was\n  carefully specified to maximise the probability of detecting an adequate\n  sample of terrestrial mammal and bird species. It was intended to monitor\n  changes in the community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates, but not\n  to monitor the abundance of individuals species. The sampling design\n  compromised between detecting species that range over large areas (&gt;100\n  km<sup>2</sup>) and those with smaller home ranges (~1 km<sup>2</sup>). The\n  camera trap array protocol outlined here differs in that it allows the\n  flexibility to monitor the community or individual species. Surveyors can\n  select the density and number of camera traps, and the deployment period based\n  on the aims of their project, with this information recorded in a standarised\n  manner among projects using the App.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you wish to undertake a general survey of the fauna across a project or\n  study area without altering the behaviour of that fauna, the\n  <em>Array</em> protocol is the most effective approach. As this protocol can\n  be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and uniformly it provides a\n  better sample size than the other protocols, thereby enabling a more accurate\n  indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this reason,\n  an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a camera trap\n  array sample is more likely to reflect a true absence (where a species is not\n  present) than the other protocols. If resources are limited, establishing a\n  transect through the most representative part of the survey area and placing\n  camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be the\n  best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect samples\n  cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is possible to\n  combine grid and transect approaches (Molloy 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Targeted</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the\n  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps at features of interest\n  within the project area, including identifying features of interest, micro\n  siting the exact camera trap point locations to optimize fauna detections,\n  installing bait stations, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap\n  make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point,\n  target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a\n  standardized manner directly into the App. The targeted protocol may be used\n  in combination with the fauna plot protocol to supplement species inventory\n  when undertaking fauna monitoring within a project area. The targeted protocol\n  has been included in recognition that deliberately biased placement of camera\n  traps at features of interest are a commonly used camera trapping sampling\n  strategy (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Targeted camera trapping can also be\n  undertaken as part of the <em>Targeted surveys</em> module and can be used in\n  combination with a range of other targeted methods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you are monitoring the behaviour of fauna under a certain set of\n  conditions, sampling fauna at a specific set of points for experimental\n  purposes (e.g., to examine responses of fauna to differing vegetation or\n  specific landscape parameters), or monitoring fauna at a place of activity or\n  gathering point such as a trail intersection, water point or nest site, the\n  <em>Targeted</em> protocol is the most effective approach. This protocol\n  allows researchers and practitioners to monitor a large area with minimal\n  resources and to answer specific research questions. However, this approach is\n  highly susceptible to bias and provides a limited insight into the ecology of\n  the greater landscape as a whole (Molloy 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The data standards for all three protocols are based on the\n  <em>Camera Trap Metadata Standard</em> developed by Forrester\n  <em>et al.</em> (2016), an open data standard for storing and sharing camera\n  trap data. The standard captures information necessary to share data between\n  projects and offers a foundation for collecting the more detailed data needed\n  for downstream analyses. The standard captures information about study design,\n  the type of camera trap used, and the location and species names for all\n  detections, among others, in a standardized manner. The standard is compatible\n  with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Darwin Core, the Ecological\n  Metadata Language, and the Audubon Core metadata standards to allow data to be\n  easily cross referenced with existing data repositories, such as DataONE\n  (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 2016).\n</p>\n<p>The <em>Camera traps</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Plot selection and layout</em> – the fauna plot protocol requires a\n      fauna plot to be selected, established and laid out.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> – Fauna habitats in the project area and fauna\n      plot selection can be informed by the results of the\n      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Vertebrate fauna</em> – camera traps can be used in combination with a\n      range of other vertebrate fauna survey methods (e.g. pitfall trapping).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Targeted surveys</em> – camera traps can be recorded as part of\n      targeted surveys and can be used in combination with a range of other\n      targeted measures.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <em>Interventions</em> – camera traps can be used to detect distribution\n      and population trends associated with interventions to conserve threatened\n      species, as well as monitor vertebrate pest population control.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pre-field survey tasks</strong></p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">\n  <strong>Study design and planning considerations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  For many camera trapping applications, such as surveying the distribution of\n  species, estimating species abundance, or monitoring changes in these\n  parameters through time, proper attention must be given to the study design,\n  the make and model of the camera trap used, camera trap deployment, and what\n  data is collected and how it will be analysed. Poorly designed surveys often\n  result in data which cannot be used to answer the question of interest\n  (Gillespie et al. 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  A clear and defined statement of the study objectives and why camera traps are\n  the best survey tool to achieve these objectives is an important component of\n  camera trapping studies, which can range from investigations of behaviour,\n  species inventory and assessing abundance, as well as exploratory, where the\n  data produced (e.g. an image of a new species, or a range extension for an\n  existing species) provides important information to address particular\n  scientific or management questions. The study design and methodology should\n  align with the clearly defined objectives (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  This section includes two decision keys (Figure 1 and Figure 2) to ensure the\n  appropriate use of camera traps and the three camera trapping protocols, as\n  well as design and planning considerations for detection, camera trap make and\n  model, the number and density of camera traps in an array, deployment period,\n  the target species, use of attractants, and permits and ethics.\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Camera trap decision keys</p>\n<p>\n  The following two decision keys will help you determine whether or not camera\n  traps are suitable to use and which protocol is recommended, based on the\n  objectives of your survey, the available resources and the target species\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Start with Decision Key 1 (Figure 1). If your survey objectives are to\n  determine species distribution, investigate habitat preferences or undertake\n  monitoring, you will continue in Decision Key 1 (Figure 1).

Camera trap surveys, which sample mobile species,\n  must consider imperfect detection at the camera trap scale, where fauna\n  passing through the relatively small camera trap detection zone fail to be\n  detected, and at the study area scale, where fauna using the study area that\n  the camera trap is assumed to sample fail to be detected (Figure) (Burton\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The probability of detection (i.e. the probability that a species will be\n  detected during a survey if it is present within the study area; Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015) is affected by several factors at the camera trap scale,\n  including camera trap specifications, deployment mode, animal body size and\n  temperature, animal movement speed, behaviour and group size, ambient\n  temperature and light, and vegetation and other obstructions, and at the study\n  area scale, including animal density and movement, the size and selection of\n  sampling units, the number and location of camera traps, the use of\n  attractant, the deployment period, and analytical assumptions (Burton\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Consideration of these factors (see below) and\n  following the carefully planned camera trapping protocols are imperative to\n  reduce detection bias in camera trap field data collection. However,\n  researchers will need to consider analytical approaches to contend with\n  imperfect detection when undertaking downstream analyses (e.g.\n  capture-mark-recapture methods, random encounter models).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Figure.

There are numerous manufacturers (e.g. Reconyx,\n  Pixcontroller, Buckeye, Cuddeback, Bushnell, Scoutguard) that typically have\n  multiple camera trap models available to researchers and practitioners. These\n  makes and models vary in their trigger speed, detection zone, sensor\n  sensitivity, how they detect fauna (e.g. PIR or AIR sensors) and how they\n  illuminate the scene at night (e.g. white or infrared flash), among others\n  (Table 2). Websites such as TrailCamPro.com provide comparative performance\n  statistics as well specifications for many popular models (Meek\n  <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The camera trap features that should be evaluated when\n  selecting a camera trap model are summarised in Table 2. Only a single model\n  of camera trap should be used in a study because performance is likely to vary\n  among models.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Recording the make and model (including the manufacturing year for models that\n  are updated frequently but keep the same name) of the camera traps used in a\n  study ensures repeatability of the methods and comparability of the results,\n  both among projects and monitoring surveys within the same project. Data of\n  the remaining camera trap features summarised in Table 2 should also be\n  collected with the camera trap make, model and year as these features are not\n  always apparent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Choosing the right tool for the job is common sense, but there are many\n  examples where a poor choice of camera trap negatively affects the outcome.\n  For example, images captured with infrared flash are monochrome and of\n  relatively low resolution compared to those taken with a white light flash.\n  Remote cameras with infrared flash are therefore not well suited to surveys of\n  species that may be difficult to identify accurately from poor-quality images,\n  such as many small mammal species. The possibility that the species of\n  interest might be disturbed by a white light flash or the noises made by\n  cameras and subsequently avoid the camera is also an important consideration\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, studies of animal use (e.g.\n  burrows, tree hollows) may be better carried out using camera traps with an\n  AIR sensor, rather than a PIR sensor, and choosing a camera trap with a small\n  detection zone and a slow trigger response may be unsuccessful in detecting\n  small and fast-moving animals at close range (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Reconyx Hyperfire camera traps are the most widely used camera trap for\n  wildlife research (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012; Meek <em>et al.</em> 2015; Meek\n  2018). Protocols that specify the use of Reconyx camera traps in Australia\n  include the standard operating procedure for camera trapping in northern\n  Australia developed by the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap\n  guidelines (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both of these protocols use Reconyx\n  HC550 or PC850 camera for data consistency and comparability. These models\n  have similar specifications and setting options, as well as LED white flash\n  capability, which importantly allows colour images to be captured during the\n  day and night, and significantly improves species identification capability\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Internationally, the Terrestrial Vertebrate\n  (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol requires the use of Reconyx camera\n  traps, particularly the HC500 or PC800 models, depending on the site’s climate\n  (PC800 models used in humid climates). This is due to their rapid response\n  time, infrared flash, multi-fire capabilities and unique design for field\n  conditions (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Table.

When ambient temperature falls within the body\n        temperature range of most mammals (31.5–36.5° C), PIR camera traps can\n        be unreliable. PIR sensors can also be triggered by the movement of\n        pockets of hot air or by the motion of warm vegetation in the detection\n        zone. This problem can be limited by avoiding pointing the camera trap\n        directly to a background that is under sun incidence. Active infrared\n        (AIR) sensors, which respond to a break in an infrared beam between two\n        units spaced apart, are not widely used but may, for example, be\n        suitable for studies of animal use of burrows or tree hollows.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Trigger speed</td>\n      <td>\n        A fundamental feature of camera traps, if not the critical feature.

This is fundamental in\n        studies that require individual recognition or for faunal inventories,\n        as colour images improve species identification. Currently, classic\n        Xenon white flashes produce sharper images than white LED flashes due to\n        their greater power and flash duration that is short enough to freeze\n        moving animals. Camera traps with infrared flash use arrays of LEDs that\n        emit infrared light, mostly in the range of 700–1000 nm. The images\n        captured are often in grey-scale or may have a reddish-pink tinge.\n        Infrared flashes tend to be less obvious to fauna, use less energy and\n        tend to have quicker trigger speeds than white flashes. Recently,\n        no-glow (also called “black”) infrared flashes have been introduced to\n        minimise the red glow emitted by standard infrared LEDs which is seen by\n        animals. A limited number of PIR camera trap models (e.g. Spypoint,\n        Bolymedia) have dual flashes (Xenon and infrared).\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Detection zone</td>\n      <td>\n        Critical feature that varies widely among current models (15.8–324.1 m;\n        Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone\n        (i.e. smaller than the field of view) usually have fast trigger speeds\n        and will take the photo when the animal is well within the field of\n        view. The detection zone can be increased to some extent by moving the\n        camera trap further away from the target, which can compensate for slow\n        trigger speeds.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Number of photos taken, recovery time, and video</td>\n      <td>\n        Capability to capture bursts of images in rapid sequence (i.e. fast\n        recovery time) may be important for improved species identification (as\n        chances of obtaining a good image within a burst will be increased),\n        recording individuals within family groups and packs, and analysis of\n        passing sequences to derive day range, which is a critical parameter in\n        the Random Encounter Model (REM; Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). At\n        night, Xenon white flash cameras are not capable to take photo bursts or\n        videos due to the recharge time of flash that can take ≥ 30 seconds, a\n        limitation that is overcome by LED white flash camera traps. Rapid image\n        sequences and video can be useful for behavioural studies or specific\n        research needs. However, data handling is more time consuming, SD cards\n        are filled quicker and power consumption is greater, hence videos are\n        not recommended when photographs alone provide the data required.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>PIR sensitivity</td>\n      <td>\n        Regulates the sensor responsiveness to the target by changing the heat\n        sensitivity threshold.

Some models enable the\n        amount of light generated by the white flash to be adjusted for two to\n        three distance settings.

The three most common\n        battery types used by camera traps are AA Lithium, Nickel Metal Hydride\n        (NiMH) and Alkaline, which are discussed in the Batteries section.\n        Despite the higher initial costs, rechargeable NiMH batteries are\n        recommended as long as camera trap performances are not altered. A\n        number of camera models (e.g. Spypoint, Bolymedia, Uway) mount an input\n        jack for external batteries or small solar panels so higher capacity,\n        lead-acid batteries can be used to prolong deployment.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Image resolution, sharpness and clarity</td>\n      <td>\n        Most camera traps capture medium-to-high resolution images and video.\n        However, the sharpness and clarity of colour images, needed to identify\n        individuals and species, are also critical features.

The option of programming the operation time, to avoid\n        unnecessary images, may be useful for example when only nocturnal\n        species are targeted. Setting camera traps to take an image at regular\n        intervals in time (i.e. time lapse), either at pre-designated intervals\n        or regular intervals following a motion detection, may be useful to\n        decrease data load while confirming presence or examine temporal\n        activity of invertebrates (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011; Potter\n        <em>et al.</em> 2021).\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Target species</p>\n<p>\n  The target species, suites of species, or community of interest should be\n  clearly identified when planning camera trap surveys. This is because the\n  study design, camera trap model, camera trap point selection, mode of\n  deployment, deployment period and type and variety of lure, if used, should be\n  tailored to the target fauna to maximise detection probability (Harmsen\n  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2013; Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016;\n  Fancourt <em>et al.</em> 2018; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a), with\n  consideration of their size, behaviour and mode of body temperature\n  regulation. For example, to maximise numbat (500–700 g mammal) detection,\n  Swift 3C wide-angle camera traps set 25 cm above the ground are recommended as\n  they recorded 89% of known events, compared to Swift 3C standard (51%) and\n  Reconyx PC900 camera traps (37%). Furthermore, camera traps mounted at 2 m\n  above the ground and angled towards the ground resulted in significantly more\n  identifications of individual numbats than those mounted at 1 m and 1.25 m\n  (Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020). If using camera traps to survey small\n  mammals, models with white flash will likely be required to capture the\n  characteristic features required to distinguish similar-looking sympatric\n  species with an acceptable level of precision (Meek and Vernes 2015). Video\n  has also been crucial to distinguish two antechinus species, with their\n  behaviour and movements being particularly diagnostic (Gray\n  <em>et al.</em> 2017).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Tracks and roads have been shown to facilitate movement of introduced\n  predators such as feral cats and foxes (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2012), and\n  consequently, placing camera traps along them will increase the probability of\n  detection (Meek 2018). Indeed, on-road detectability using camera traps was\n  estimated to be seven times higher for cats and three times higher for foxes\n  than off-road detectability. Furthermore, targeting camera trap survey effort\n  on-road yielded the greatest power for detecting declines in both species\n  (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), which is useful for monitoring the success of\n  lethal baiting programs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The majority of camera traps work by sensing objects that move and are a\n  different temperature relative to the background surface and objects. They are\n  therefore most suited to detecting mammals and to a lesser extent birds (i.e.\n  endotherms; TEAM Network 2011b; Cloyed <em>et al.</em> 2018), but are\n  generally less sensitive at detecting reptiles and amphibians (i.e.\n  ectotherms; Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, camera traps positioned\n  facing downwards have successfully monitored reptiles using bait stations to\n  attract species to the detection zone, drift fences to direct species towards\n  the detection zone, and cork tiles to create a sufficient thermal contrast\n  between the tile, which is heated by the sun, and the species (Welbourne\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a). More recently, this\n  approach was refined by reducing the focal length of Reconxy camera traps to\n  avoid blurry images of when placing them facing downwards, 70 cm above the\n  ground, This allowed small, similar looking sympatric species to be\n  differentiated (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2019). Reconyx can alter the focal\n  length of their professional series of camera traps at the time of purchase,\n  but it is also possible for practitioners to adjust this themselves, as\n  demonstrated by Welbourne <em>et al.</em> (2019).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For amphibians, camera traps set to capture time lapse images, or a\n  combination of sensor triggered and time lapse images have been successfully\n  used to monitor movements (Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011), and describe\n  activity patterns and behaviour (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2010; Engbrecht and\n  Lannoo 2012), including for a rare and elusive micro-endemic frog species\n  strictly dependent on bromeliads (Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ultimately, the target animals influence several study design considerations\n  of camera trap surveys, meaning suitable ecological research is critical to a\n  well-designed study (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). If possible, rigorous,\n  species-specific testing should be undertaken to complement the use of\n  well-regarded camera trap models and general deployment recommendations\n  (Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Camera trap point selection and preparation</p>\n<p>\n  When choosing the exact location for a camera trap point, careful attention to\n  where the camera trap is located and to site preparation can improve\n  detection, facilitate species identification and significantly reduce the\n  incidences of false triggers. On approaching the camera trap point, look for a\n  suitable place to set the camera trap (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Look\n  for signs of fauna (e.g. tracks, scats) and features with a good chance of\n  animal visitation (e.g. animal trails, creek banks, dry creek beds, narrow\n  gullies, edges of dense vegetation, paths to water). Consider the target\n  species or suite of species and their travel habits, the likely path of\n  travel, the sensor’s range and field of view, and the terrain. Select the\n  location that is likely to detect your target species or yield the greatest\n  number of images of a suite of species, depending on the aims of your project\n  (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  An ideal location is a flat or gently sloping area that is relatively clear of\n  shrubs and ground vegetation, but is shaded by trees or rock over-hangs. If\n  deploying camera traps in a rocky or densely vegetated habitat, think\n  carefully how fauna might access the point; if access is limited then this\n  will influence the detection probability (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Set the ‘stage’ for the camera trap. Occasionally, terrain or vegetation can\n  obstruct the detection zone. Remove vegetation as needed, considering windy\n  conditions, to maximise detection within the field of view of the camera trap\n  and minimise false triggers. Try to keep the stage as natural as possible,\n  taking care not to disturb the area too much or create obstructions of cleared\n  vegetation (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p>\n  If using bait stations, it may be best to remove all vegetation around the\n  bait station to ensure an uninterrupted view of fauna inspecting the bait and\n  prevent false triggers. The vegetation around the base of the camera trap\n  mount or tree to which the camera trap is attached to minimise the risk of\n  fire damage to camera traps (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Mode of deployment</p>\n<p>\n  How a camera trap is deployed in the field (i.e. its height, angle, direction)\n  can greatly improve detection probability and reduce false triggers. The\n  detection zone of the PIR sensor in most camera traps is a wedge-shaped,\n  horizontal band (or bands) spreading outwards from the front of the sensor. As\n  a result, the detection zone increases in size with increasing distance from\n  the sensor. Setting camera traps so that the sensor is at different heights\n  above the ground and at different distances from the target area (e.g. a bait\n  station) allows different sized fauna species to be targeted. Setting camera\n  traps close to the ground (i.e. 15–20 cm), or higher and angled so that they\n  point towards the ground, will record the greatest size range of animals, as\n  sensors will be triggered by both smaller animals and the legs of larger\n  animals. The camera trap’s field of view is more expansive vertically and\n  generally wider than the sensor’s detection zone, so although only the legs of\n  an animal may trigger the sensor the photograph will contain more of the\n  animal. Detection zone area varies widely among camera trap models (see Meek\n  et al. 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone (i.e. smaller than the\n  camera field of view) have usually fast trigger speeds and will take the photo\n  when the animal is well within the field of view (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  When targeting large animals, such as kangaroos, camera traps should be set so\n  that the sensor is at the height of the animal’s shoulder (e.g. approximately\n  1 m above the ground). This will reduce the number of images of smaller\n  non-target species, as these animals will be underneath the detection zone\n  (Figure 4). A maximum distance of 5 m between the camera trap and the target\n  area (e.g. a trail along which an animal may be walking) should allow adequate\n  illumination and reduce the likelihood of animals being obscured by vegetation\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For medium-sized animals (e.g. quolls, bandicoots, possums), the camera trap\n  should be set so that the sensor is approximately 50 cm above the ground\n  (Figure 4). A distance of 3 m between the camera and the target area (e.g.\n  bait station) will ensure the animal is in the foreground of the photograph\n  and is clearly illuminated by the flash (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). For\n  example, for bandicoots, camera traps are deployed approximately 50 cm above\n  ground level in locations with evidence of recent diggings or suitable\n  habitat, with inaccessible bait stations with rolled oats, honey and peanut\n  butter (5:1:2 ratio; truffle oil optional at 20 ml/kg) bait attractant set up\n  1–3 m in front of each camera trap. Vegetation is removed to ground level\n  between the camera trap and bait station and within 1 m around the bait\n  station if necessary (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚\n  Population and Communities 2011).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For small mammals, studies have found that a sensor height of approximately\n  20–30 cm above the ground, or downward facing camera traps increase detection\n  (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017; Dundas\n  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020). When targeting small\n  mammals set the remote camera close to the target area (e.g. 1.5 m between the\n  camera and bait station). Although small mammals are detected by remote\n  cameras targeting medium-sized mammals, setting the camera close to the target\n  area will capture the fine detail required for identifying certain small\n  mammal species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Setting camera traps to optimise detection of a wide range of species requires\n  a balanced approach; there is no one size fits all. One option is to maximise\n  the sensor sensitivity and the picture frame; set the camera up so that it is\n  angled down towards a feature or bait station such that the field of view\n  covers an area of ground from the foreground of the feature or bait station\n  within 1.5 m of the camera trap to several metres beyond the feature or bait\n  station. For single camera deployments, the bait station to camera distance\n  should be 2.5 m. However, by deploying multiple cameras at a site, variable\n  setups can also be incorporated, such as varying the bait station distance\n  from 1.5 – 2.5 m (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  For predators including cats, foxes and dogs, camera traps should be placed 30\n  cm from a road or track edge, 50 cm above the ground, set parallel to the\n  ground (although this may vary depending on topography), oriented 23° to the\n  road or track and facing away from the sun’s path, facing south and in shade\n  is optimal. The detection point should be 4–6 m from the camera trap in the\n  middle of the road or track. Rock outcrops, reflective surfaces and shadows in\n  the field of view should be avoided, as well as vegetation close enough that\n  it can blow into the field of view (Meek 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Camera traps should be set so that they are facing south to prevent false\n  triggers from sun glare and shadowing, and minimise sun damage to the camera\n  lens and sensor. Avoid deploying with east and west-facing orientations to\n  reduce false triggers from the rising and setting of the sun. If using a tree\n  to mount a camera trap, select a solid tree that will not move in the wind\n  (diameter greater than 20 cm), with a relatively straight trunk and with a\n  clear area to the south to direct the camera trap (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Figure.

Because this heat difference is larger in cold\n  temperatures, PIR sensors are more sensitive in temperate environments or\n  during cooler seasons. High sensitivity is typically better to detect\n  small-sized mammals. Reducing the sensitivity may also help avoid the problem\n  of false triggers during the day due to heated vegetation, passing shadows or\n  heated ground. However, by reducing the sensitivity there is a risk that some\n  animals may not trigger the camera, especially in warm environments\n  experienced in many parts of northern Australia where there is less difference\n  between an animal’s body temperature and that of its surroundings. For cameras\n  with SD cards that have the capacity to retain large numbers of images on a\n  single set of batteries, large numbers of false triggers are less problematic\n  and the maximum sensitivity setting is recommended to avoid missing animals\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, the data storage and processing\n  implications of this need to be considered.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Activation time settings allow camera traps to be set to operate continuously,\n  only at night, or only during the day. Some camera traps can also be\n  programmed to operate between particular times (e.g., 0500–0800 hours). When\n  targeting species that are strictly nocturnal, setting the camera trap for\n  night operation only will eliminate many false trigger events during the day\n  and reduce the number of images of non-target species. Reliable knowledge of\n  the activity patterns of the target species and testing of cameras to\n  determine the level of light required will aid in determining whether this is\n  an appropriate setting for nocturnal animals that may also be active at dawn\n  and dusk (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many camera traps include a feature that allows for a pause (e.g., 15, 30\n  seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes) between successive triggers. This will reduce\n  the number of photographs taken of the same animal (e.g., if animals linger\n  for long periods at bait stations) and may be useful in areas where there are\n  very high levels of animal activity, especially of non-target species (e.g.,\n  where macropods are common). The appropriate length of the delay will depend\n  largely on the target species; a minimal delay will maximize the chances of\n  obtaining multiple photographs of rare or cryptic species, while a longer\n  delay would be appropriate when targeting slower moving animals that may\n  travel in groups, such as macropods or feral herbivores (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Trigger speed (i.e., the speed with which a camera trap captures an image\n  relative to when the sensor detects the animal) can be adjusted in some camera\n  trap models. If available, this function can be useful for optimising\n  detection of different species that may move through the field of view at\n  different speeds, without the need for purchasing different camera trap models\n  with different trigger speeds. Multiple trigger options in some camera traps,\n  such as Reconyx, allow programming of camera traps to capture several images\n  in quick succession each time the camera trap is triggered. This capability\n  increases the likelihood of multiple images of the same animal, aiding in\n  accurate species identification. The flash range is adjustable in some camera\n  traps via the shutter speed setting (e.g., Reconyx). A slow shutter increases\n  the flash range but also increases the potential for a blurry image. A fast\n  shutter reduces flash range but results in a cleaner image. For smaller and\n  faster moving animals, a faster shutter is recommended (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Time lapse settings allow programming the camera trap to take photos at\n  predetermined time intervals, without being triggered. This function may be\n  useful for recording the presence of species that do not readily trigger\n  infra-red sensors, such as amphibians and invertebrates (Hoffman\n  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011; Engbrecht and Lannoo\n  2012; Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018; Potter <em>et al.</em> 2021), or for\n  monitoring ecological processes, such as plant phenology (Kim\n  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Some camera traps can also be set to capture video when\n  they are triggered, which may be useful in behavioural studies (Hoffman\n  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Krauss <em>et al.</em> 2018), distinguishing sympatric\n  species (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017), or individual identification in\n  mark-recapture studies (Mattioli <em>et al.</em> 2018).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Attractant</p>\n<p>\n  Camera trap surveys often use lures to attract fauna into the detection zone\n  of camera traps, thereby maximising the likelihood of detection. This is\n  particularly important when targeting wide ranging species that occur at low\n  densities and that do not use predictable travel routes or habitats where\n  camera traps can be deployed. Without the attractive effects of a lure, the\n  likelihood that such species will happen to pass by the camera trap and be\n  detected may be very low (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, when using\n  systematic camera trap arrays in surveys of occupancy and relative abundance,\n  which rely on assumptions of equal detectability (Burton\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015), lures should not be used to attract fauna to the camera\n  trap points (TEAM Network 2011b; Meek 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lures can be edible (i.e. baits which may also have an attractive scent),\n  olfactory (i.e. scent), auditory (i.e. sound) or visual. Common lures used to\n  attract feral cats include baits (fresh chicken coated with fish oil),\n  auditory lures (Feline Audio Phonic, Westcare Industries, Perth, WA,\n  Australia), and scent lures (Catastrophic, a proprietary product developed by\n  Outfoxed Pest Control, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) (Stokeld\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Visual attractants, consisting of a white and pink\n  feathers and a shiny compact disk to appeal to cat hunting instincts and\n  increase the ability of a cat to detect the lure station, are often used in\n  association with other types of lures (Bengsen <em>et al.</em> 2011). Stokeld\n  <em>et al.</em> (2015) found no evidence that feral cats in northern Australia\n  are more attracted to any of these specific bait types.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When using baits, the choice of bait depends on the food preferences of the\n  species being targeted. When targeting carnivores, meat baits have generally\n  been used in Australia, including chunks of raw chicken, kangaroo, rabbit or\n  fish (e.g. pilchards, tuna log, perforated tins of cat food) and fish oil.\n  However, meat and fish can putrefy very quickly, which may in fact act as a\n  deterrent to some species. A standard mammal trapping bait mix of peanut\n  butter, rolled oats and honey has been successfully used in surveys targeting\n  a wide variety of small- and medium-sized native mammals, such as quolls,\n  bandicoots, possums and rodents (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of\n  manufactured, lethal baits are commercially available for vertebrate pest\n  management (e.g. FOXOFF®, FOXECUTE®, DOGABAIT®, CUROSITY®, Animal Control\n  Technologies (Australia), Somerton, VIC, Australia), and these may serve as\n  lures for camera trap studies targeting these species.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Placing baits and olfactory lures inside containers that allow airflow (e.g.\n  small cages, tea infusers, perforated PVC pipes) suspended above the ground\n  will protect them from removal by target and non-target species, and ensure\n  that their attractiveness persists for as long as possible. Species including\n  corvids, rodents, dingoes, and ants can interfere severely with baits.\n  Attaching the bait container to a pole (e.g. star picket, wooden stake)\n  secures it and provides greater flexibility in positioning of the bait in\n  relation to the camera trap. Ants can be deterred by spreading dust or\n  granular insecticide for ants around the base of the pole (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The NT Flora and Fauna Division has devised a bait container that is suitable\n  for most baits and deployments and can be quickly constructed from readily\n  available materials. The bait container is constructed using a short (80 mm)\n  length of 50 mm PVC pipe with a wire-mesh ventilated end cap, an overhanging\n  cover on the top and slit-ventilated bottom cap. The plumbing descriptions for\n  the end caps are ‘vent water/insect proof PVC 50 mm’ for the top and ‘vent\n  insect proof PVC 50 mm’ for the bottom (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Number and density of cameras</p>\n<p>\n  The number of camera trap points, whether single or multiple camera traps are\n  allocated per camera trap point, the distance between camera trap points, the\n  spatial coverage of a sampling unit, and the total survey area are all\n  important considerations for camera trapping studies. An adequate number of\n  camera trap points is required to ensure the sampling effort can reliably\n  detect an effect relative to the total survey area. When determining this\n  number, the desired levels of accuracy and precision must be considered\n  relative to other influential factors, such as the increasing cost of\n  deployment with each camera trap and the heterogeneity of the study area (Meek\n  <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Table 3 outlines a rough guide to the minimum number\n  of camera trap points with a single camera trap for occupancy surveys based on\n  how common or rare and detectable a species is (Gillespie\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The daily detection probability of the camera traps and the number of repeat\n  surveys that are carried out at each camera trap point (i.e. the number of\n  camera trap nights) should also be considered when determining the number of\n  camera trap points. In general, surveying more camera trap points a greater\n  number of times using the camera trap settings and deployment mode with the\n  highest probability of detection, will maximise the precision of the estimate\n  of the rate of occupancy. However, there are usually conflicts and trade-offs\n  between these three aims. For example, if limited numbers of camera traps are\n  available for use on a particular project, then carrying out many days of\n  survey at each camera trap point will limit the total number of points which\n  can be surveyed over the course of a survey season. The expected precision\n  associated with a particular sampling program can be calculated if reasonable\n  estimates regarding the occupancy rate amongst the sampled camera trap points\n  and probability of detection are available prior to the survey. This\n  information may be available from a previous study of the same species, from\n  pilot studies, or from expert opinion (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The distance between camera trap points, or camera trap spacing, will vary\n  depending on the ecology of the target species and needs to be properly scaled\n  to suitably sample the target species and ensure the independence of\n  observations at adjacent camera trap points. The home ranges of target species\n  should be considered and reported. More widely spaced camera traps will be\n  appropriate for wide-ranging animals with large home ranges, while closer\n  spacing is generally more suitable for species with smaller home ranges\n  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Where camera trap points are in a regular\n  grid or transect, as in the array protocol, distance between cameras can be\n  recorded as a single value. However, where camera trap points are randomly or\n  irregularly located, as in the targeted protocol, the average, minimum and\n  maximum distance among the points along with a measure of the distribution of\n  distances (e.g. standard deviation) should be recorded. For the latter, the\n  survey area can be defined by calculating the areas enclosed by either the\n  concave or convex perimeter of camera trap points (Meek\n  <em>et al.</em> 2014a).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Where multiple species are being surveyed, detection bias needs to be\n  considered as it is difficult to achieve an optimal camera trap spacing for a\n  suite of species, and you are likely to end up with increased detection\n  probability for some species and decreased detection probability for others\n  (Harmsen <em>et al.</em> 2010; Foster and Harmsen 2012; Mann\n  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Studies assessing the species richness of terrestrial\n  mammals vary considerably in camera trap spacing, including &lt;1 km (Trolle\n  and Kéry 2005; Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2014; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018), 1\n  km (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018), 1.5 km (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2003), 2 km\n  (Tobler <em>et al.</em> 2008; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018) and varied spacing\n  between 1.75 and &gt;5 km within the same study area (Srbek-Araujo and\n  Chiarello 2013). Arrays of 20–30 camera traps at a density of one camera trap\n  per 2 km<sup>2</sup> are used to monitor changes in the community of\n  ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions (TEAM Network\n  2011b), whereas a robust predator monitoring program will often have at least\n  20–30 camera traps spaced approximately 1 km apart (Meek 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Deploying more than one camera trap at each sampling location, as in the fauna\n  plot protocol, will usually be expected to lead to an increase in the\n  probability of detecting a species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Deploying\n  multiple camera traps per camera trap point in an array may also be useful to\n  determine occupancy, detectability and power to monitor population change of\n  species among micro-habitats (e.g. monitoring feral cats and foxes on- and\n  off-road; Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), or to assess the influence of camera\n  trap placement relative to a grid point based on the number and type of animal\n  signs (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  A rough guide to the minimum deployment periods and number of camera trap\n  points with a single camera trap for occupancy surveys.\n</p>\n<p>\n  These values will vary depending on the ecology of the target species\n  (Gillespie et al. 2015).\n</p>\n<table>\n  <colgroup>\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <col />\n  </colgroup>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Species</th>\n      <th>Minimum number of weeks to deploy</th>\n      <th>Minimum number of camera trap points to sample</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Common and easy to detect</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>30</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Common but hard to detect</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>40</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rare but easy to detect</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>150</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Rare and hard to detect</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>180</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Deployment period</p>\n<p>\n  The deployment period of camera traps determines how many daily replicate\n  samples are collected (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with datasets improving\n  with increasing deployment periods (Kays et al 2009). This variable has been\n  found to be a more important factor than camera trap spacing and microsite\n  placement at grid points in providing accurate species richness estimates\n  (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ultimately, the optimal deployment time will\n  depend on your target species, meaning further research should be undertaken\n  to adequately prepare for your survey (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012).\n</p>\n<p>\n  A common camera trap deployment period is 2–4 weeks (Kays\n  <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, how common or rare a species is in the\n  landscape and the detection probability will affect decisions around the\n  deployment period of camera traps (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some\n  cases, including where the number of camera trap points sampled is more\n  important for analysis than deployment period (Kays <em>et al.</em> 2011), or\n  during a pilot study to confirm that traps can adequately detect certain\n  species and allow accurate identification (Meek and Vernes 2015), camera traps\n  may be deployed for less than 2 weeks. However, the minimum recommended\n  deployment period of camera traps to monitor small- and medium-sized mammals\n  in Australia is 14 nights (Paull <em>et al.</em> 2011). A deployment period of\n  30 nights for each of 20–30 camera traps is used to monitor changes in the\n  community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions\n  (TEAM Network 2011b). Similarly, camera traps are recommended to be deployed\n  for a minimum period of four weeks to monitor predators (Meek 2018).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Table 3 outlines a rough guide to the minimum number of weeks to deploy camera\n  traps for occupancy surveys based on how common or rare and detectable a\n  species is (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Whereas Table 4 outlines the\n  estimated deployment periods required to achieve a detection probability\n  &gt;0.7 for feral cats using 2–5 camera traps placed in and around a 50 x 50 m\n  fauna plot. At each plot, five camera traps were deployed in a diamond\n  configuration, with a single camera trap in the centre and four camera traps\n  placed 30–100 m from the centre point (Stokeld <em>et al.</em> 2015). The\n  camera trap layouts for the Fauna plot protocol are similar to those used by\n  Stokeld <em>et al.</em> (2015), but have been adapted to align with the 100 x\n  100 m fauna plot (see Appendix A).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The maximum camera trap deployment period is also usually limited by battery\n  life or the storage capacity of SD cards. If camera traps are not required for\n  use at other camera trap points, then deploying camera traps for a length of\n  time close to the expected endurance of the batteries and/or SD card storage\n  capacity is a good strategy. This is because the cost of leaving a deployed\n  camera trap out for a few extra days is effectively zero – no additional staff\n  time or resources are required for a 30-day deployment for example, compared\n  to a 10-day deployment. By maximising the length of the deployments, a greater\n  effective number of daily replicate samples are collected at each camera trap\n  point, and hence a longer sequence of detection and non-detection events is\n  accumulated at each point. Statistically, this leads to more precise\n  estimation of both the probability of detection and the rate of occupancy.\n  When either the number of camera trap points or number of replicate samples is\n  increased the precision of the occupancy estimates improves. However, the\n  improvement in the estimate is far better when the number of camera trap\n  points surveyed is increased (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Table.

The camera trap layouts for the fauna\n  plot protcol are similar to those used by Stokeld et al. (2015), but have been\n  adapted to align with the 100 x 100 m fauna plot (see Appendix A).\n</p>\n<table>\n  <colgroup>\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <col />\n  </colgroup>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Number of camera traps</th>\n      <th>\n        Deployment period<br />\n        (weeks)\n      </th>\n      <th>Detection probability</th>\n      <th>\n        Related camera trap layout<br />\n        (see Appendix A)\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0.705</td>\n      <td>A</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>0.727</td>\n      <td>B</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>0.709</td>\n      <td>C or D</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>0.704</td>\n      <td>E</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Storage and transport</p>\n<p>\n  Camera traps should be stored in a safe location and transported in sealed,\n  padded containers to prevent accidental damage, water damage, dust damage and\n  theft (Gillespie et al. 2015). When packing the camera traps to take in the\n  field do not store them with food or any other substances that might leave an\n  odour on the camera trap. Food or other scents might attract fauna to the\n  camera trap in the field, biasing the estimates of detection probability. Do\n  not carry camera traps and food in the same bag when walking to camera trap\n  points. An open backpack frame to which the camera traps can be strapped is a\n  practical solution to carry camera traps in the field (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Permits and ethics</p>\n<p>\n  A key feature of remote cameras, in contrast to many other wildlife survey\n  techniques, is that they are relatively non-invasive; animals don’t need to be\n  physically captured or handled as part of the survey. From an ethical and\n  animal welfare point of view, remote camera surveys are only minimally\n  intrusive, with impacts on animals limited to minor disturbance caused by\n  flashes and camera noise, and behavioural responses to baits and minor habitat\n  disturbance. For these reasons, animal ethics approvals may still be required\n  for implementing remote camera surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).\n</p>\n<p>\n  You should contact the relevant animal ethics committee to ensure you have the\n  required animal ethics approvals well in advance of your field survey. You\n  will need to consider how often the animal ethics committee meets and the\n  timeframe for approvals to be granted. It is also wise to allow time to\n  address any queries from the committee or conditions that must be met prior to\n  an approval being granted.\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">\n  <strong>Camera trap preparation and calibration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The <em>Camera traps</em> module depends on the camera traps being in proper\n  functioning order, so taking adequate care and maintenance of the camera traps\n  essential. To ensure the highest possible quality and integrity of the data,\n  close attention must be paid to preparing and calibrating the camera traps\n  before they are deployed in the field. Preparations should be started no later\n  than 1 week before a field survey (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Camera trap identification</p>\n<p>\n  Before camera traps are deployed in the field they need to be allocated and\n  marked with an identification number. Camera traps should also be registered\n  in an equipment management database to keep track of their location (e.g. in\n  storage, assigned to project RLP001), current firmware, and operational status\n  (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Clearly mark each camera trap externally with a unique identification\n      number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent, water resistant marker.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Retrieve the serial number of each camera trap from the white sticker\n      underneath the control panel.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Record the <em>Camera trap number</em> and <em>Serial number</em> of each\n      camera trap in an equipment management database (e.g. spreadsheet).

Ensure you check the relevant website for updates and instructions for\n  updating before each field survey or camera trap redeployment. As an example,\n  the steps to update the firmware on Reconyx camera traps, which are used in\n  the Fauna plot protocol, are provided below (Bush Heritage Australia 2021).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">Reconyx firmware updates</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Navigate to the ‘SUPPORT’ tab and ‘Firmware Updates’ link on the Reconyx\n      website to access the most recent firmware update.

Refer to the\n  user manual for your camera trap make and model for instructions to navigate\n  the control panel.\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">Fauna plot protocol camera settings</p>\n<p>\n  The fauna plot protocol uses Reconyx camera traps with a standardized settings\n  configuration. Although Reconyx camera traps have some pre-programmed ‘QUICK\n  SET’ settings configurations, these can vary between models. Therefore, you\n  must configure the settings for the fauna plot protocol using the ‘ADVANCED’\n  menu. The following settings are required to maximise the likelihood of\n  detections in the fauna plot protocol. It is noted that by increasing the\n  likelihood of detection you also increase the likelihood of false triggers.\n  However, explicit site preparation techniques and camera trap placement and\n  orientation in the field are used to reduce the likelihood of false triggers.\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Open the camera trap and insert a spare set of batteries to configure the\n      settings.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Switch the camera trap ‘ON’ and navigate to the ‘ADVANCED’ menu.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the sensor sensitivity to ‘High’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the pictures per trigger to ‘5’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the picture interval to ‘RapidFire’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set quiet period to ‘No Delay’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the image resolution to ‘3.1 MP’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set night mode to ‘Fast Shutter’ to increase image sharpness.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Set the Date and Time and the unit of temperature to ‘Celcius’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Set the user label (i.e. relevant project, camera and/or camera trap point\n      code).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Leave the remaining default settings.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"12\" type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Return to the main menu and set the battery type to match the batteries\n      that will be used during the survey.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">Array and targeted protocols</p>\n<p>\n  The array and targeted protocols allow you to configure camera trap settings\n  based on your camera trap make and model, the purpose of your survey,\n  available resources, and the target species (see Study design considerations\n  and planning).

SD cards have various storage capacities and\n  reading and writing speeds. Larger capacity cards are capable of storing more\n  images and video. Several factors will influence your required storage\n  capacity, including deployment period, target species, site conditions,\n  selected image quality and whether you are capturing video. Most users find\n  that 4GB or 8GB cards are more than adequate for general use, with capacity to\n  store between approximately 4,000 and 8,000 3.1MP images, respectively. You\n  may want to consider a larger storage capacity if camera traps are being\n  deployed for a long period, the risk of false triggers is high, or you are\n  capturing video. Ensure you check the maximum capacity SD card that your\n  camera traps will accept.\n</p>\n<p>\n  SD cards with higher speed ratings are capable of reading and writing images\n  faster, which is particularly advantageous when capturing RapidFire image\n  sequences. Speed Class 10 SD cards, which are capable of high reading and\n  writing speeds with a minimum write speed of 10MB/s, are recommend. It is also\n  recommended that you purchase two SD cards per camera trap, so they can be\n  easily swapped when redeploying camera traps.\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">SD card identification</p>\n<p>\n  Before SD cards are used in camera traps that are deployed in the field, they\n  need to be allocated and marked with an identification number. Similar to\n  camera traps, SD cards should also be registered in an equipment management\n  database to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned to project\n  RLP001, assigned to camera 01), (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network\n  2011b).\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Clearly mark each SD card externally with a unique identification number\n      (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent, water resistant marker.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Retrieve the serial number of each SD card from the back of the SD card.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Record the <em>SD card number</em> and <em>Serial number</em> of each SD\n      card in an equipment management database (e.g. spreadsheet). Other data\n      you may wish to record includes the SD card <em>Brand</em>,\n      <em>Type</em> (SD, SDHC, SDHX), <em>Purchase</em><em>date</em>,\n      <em>Storage capacity</em>, <em>Format</em> (e.g. FAT32),\n      <em>Format date</em>, and <em>Current location</em>.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">SD card formatting</p>\n<p>\n  Formatting an SD card effectively erases all the card data, giving you a\n  fresh, empty folder structure to work with. After you have backed up your SD\n  card after each field survey, you should format each SD card before the next\n  field survey. This will ensure data from different surveys is not mixed up.\n  Furthermore, regular formatting of SD cards can lower the risk of corrupt\n  files.\n</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>Ensure your data from the previous field survey is backed up.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Insert your SD card into your computer’s SD card reader (or use an\n      external SD card reader).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For Windows, you should see your SD card under the list of available\n      drives. Right-click on the drive and select ‘Format’. Under ‘File system’\n      select ‘FAT32’ if the SD card is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB\n      or greater, select ‘ExFAT’ then click on ‘Start’. Select ‘OK’ to ignore\n      the warning that the data on the drive will be erased and begin formatting\n      the SD card.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For Mac, open Disk Utility and select the SD card on the left side of the\n      window. Click on the ‘ERASE’ tab and then click on the ‘Format’ drop-down\n      menu. Select ‘MS-DOS (FAT)’ if the SD card is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD\n      card is 64 GB or greater, select ‘ExFAT’. Click ‘Erase’. Your Mac will\n      delete the contents of your SD card and format it.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Record the SD card <em>Format</em> and <em>Format date</em> of each SD\n      card in an equipment management database (e.g. spreadsheet; see SD card\n      identification).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Insert a formatted SD card into each camera trap so they are ready for the\n      survey.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Batteries</p>\n<p>\n  Each camera trap can require up 12 AA batteries depending on the make and\n  model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user manual of the\n  camera traps you are using and consideration of your study requirements. The\n  three most common battery types used are Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH), lithium\n  and alkaline. Longer lasting batteries such as rechargeable NiMH and lithium\n  batteries are preferred over alkaline batteries (TEAM Network 2011b), which\n  tend to discharge quicker and also suffer in extreme cold weather (Meek\n  <em>et al.</em> 2012).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Rechargeable and lithium batteries have similar upfront costs (excluding\n  chargers). However, rechargeable batteries are a better long-term option and\n  recommended for their reliability, longevity, and sustainability. In\n  Australia, Eneloop and Eneloop Pro batteries are good quality and have been\n  recommended by experts (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is common practice to\n  have two complete sets of rechargeable batteries per camera trap, which\n  enables the seamless redeployment of camera traps within and between studies.\n  Instructions for preparing rechargeable batteries for the field are outlined\n  below (TEAM Network 2011b).\n</p>\n<p style=\"color: orange\">Rechargeable NiMH battery preparation</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If charging the batteries for the first time, or the first time for a\n      given field season, put them in a discharging-recharging cycle\n      (conditioning cycle) at least 48 hours before leaving for the field. This\n      ensures that the battery “memory” is properly set and prolongs the life of\n      the rechargeable battery. Refer to the battery charger for instructions to\n      put the batteries into a condition cycle. Only use battery chargers that\n      have this specification. Depending on the number of camera traps you have,\n      multiple large battery chargers may be required to be used in parallel to\n      prepare for the field.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If not charging the batteries for the first time, discharge them first and\n      recharge them for at least 24 hours before leaving for the field survey.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Once the batteries are finished charging, check they have adequate voltage\n      using a voltmeter. Rechargeable batteries will show a lower voltage than\n      their posted voltage of 1.5 V, but this is normal for these battery types\n      (between 1.25 and 1.3 V).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Try not to charge the batteries more than 2–3 days before taking them into\n      the field.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Within 1–2 days of the field survey, insert the charged batteries into\n      each camera trap so they are ready for the survey.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Do not use the rechargeable batteries prepared for the field survey to\n      configure the camera trap settings (see below). Use a spare set of\n      batteries.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: blue\">Desiccant</p>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If the camera traps are being deployed in humid or wet conditions, place a\n      packet of desiccant (silica gel) inside each camera trap housing to help\n      protect the electronics from moisture.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"color: blue\"><strong>Camera trap array preparation</strong></p>\n<p>\n  Prior to a field survey using the array protocol, an initial desktop exercise\n  using species information, satellite imagery and GIS spatial data layers,\n  along with any other information relevant to the project, is required to\n  establish and geo-reference a camera trap array (i.e. a systematic grid or\n  transect/s of camera trap points). Decisions on the camera trap array should\n  be based on the best available biological and geographical information (see\n  Table 5).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Compile the essential GIS spatial data layers prior to the generation of the\n  camera trap array (Table 5). These layers will contribute to an accurate\n  assessment of optimal placement of the camera trap array within the project\n  area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The broad-scale locations of camera trap points (e.g. 1 km spacing) are\n  established and geo-referenced through the desktop assessment process, and\n  loaded into the App on the mobile device. Fine-scale camera trap locations,\n  within close proximity (e.g. 20 m) to the broad-scale locations, are\n  determined in the field based on suitable camera trap placement locations to\n  maximise detection of the target fauna.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Table.

Enter the desired\n      point spacing in Distance. This value should be in the units your layer’s\n      projection uses (probably meters). If using a set distance, enter 0 for\n      both the number of rows and columns (these will be determined\n      automatically). You can also choose the number of points desired and the\n      point spacing will be set automatically, though for most sampling it’s\n      simpler to adjust the distance. Ensure Create Label Points (optional) is\n      checked and set the Geometry Type (optional) to Line.

These should include a good quality road or\n      track along which a vehicle can travel into or through the project area\n      (see Figure 7B).

Identify existing tracks and trails, as well as passages that may\n      be suitable for temporary access routes. Consider if temporary access\n      routes are required to undertake other modules and if these can be\n      combined with camera trap array temporary access routes.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Verify that the camera trap arrays will be accessible during the entire\n      proposed deployment period (e.g. a property owner might close off a\n      paddock/s for stocking reasons, limiting access).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Identify impenetrable areas.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Overlay a land cover/vegetation map.

For the majority of project areas, the most\n      readily available product will be a coarse SRTM-derived Digital Elevation\n      Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 90 m. These data will provide an\n      idea of significant changes in elevation.

Analyse the DEM to ascertain\n      if there are any significant elevation gradients evident (i.e. a\n      difference of &gt;1000 m between lowest and highest elevations within the\n      project area or study area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If there is a major altitudinal gradient within the project area or study\n      area, you may consider generating multiple camera trapping grids or\n      transects along this gradient (e.g. in three strata: low elevation, mid\n      elevation and high elevation).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Identify rocky outcroppings by interpreting a satellite image. These areas\n      may be digitised and then clipped out of the extent of the project area or\n      study area before the camera trap array is generated.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Identify steep slopes that would prohibit traversing or sampling. To\n      identify the slopes, derive a slope map from a DEM. Areas that are &gt;45\n      degrees are masked out. Use this mask layer to omit those areas from the\n      project area or study area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Identify seasonally inundated areas, big ponds, or streams that may be\n      impassable during the proposed deployment period. If these areas are\n      easily identifiable, they can be digitised directly from an up-to-date\n      satellite image. It should be noted that identifying inundated areas,\n      especially seasonally inundated areas, can be very difficult and that\n      consulting an expert with local knowledge of the area is highly\n      recommended.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Identify open areas, or large gaps that are unsuitable for sampling. These\n      may be digitised directly from an up-to-date satellite image also or from\n      assistance of local expert who has knowledge of the area.

This module\n  is undertaken within fauna monitoring plots, adjacent to the vegetation and\n  soil plots. Figure 1 shows the layout for the protocols that are undertaken at\n  fixed locations within the plot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The module offers nine sampling protocols, targeting different invertebrate\n  groups, as summarised in Table 2. The survey design and equipment for each\n  protocol is standardised to ensure comparability of the results across\n  projects. Where applicable, the protocols follow existing, established\n  protocols and draw on current research. Users determine which of the nine\n  protocols should be undertaken for their project needs; at a minimum the\n  Active search and Micro-pitfall trapping protocols are undertaken at the start\n  of a project, and Micro-pitfall trapping is repeated for monitoring.\n  Implementing a range of complementary sampling protocols is strongly\n  recommended, especially at the start of a project, to provide a baseline for\n  inventory and monitoring. A post-field protocol covers the requirements for\n  sample curation relevant to all protocols.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The need to undertake the Invertebrate fauna module and, subsequently, the\n  selection of sampling protocols is determined at the start of a project\n  depending on the project objectives and their suitability for the situation.\n  The results and project objectives should also inform which protocols to\n  repeat, and how often. Repeat sampling using a range of methods increases the\n  ability to detect different indicator species/functional groups, and therefore\n  monitor trends.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The protocols are ideally undertaken at the same time as the vertebrate fauna\n  and vegetation and soil monitoring (with consideration given to season). The\n  number of plots that require sampling will be determined at the start of the\n  project (see Introduction Chapter). The repeat survey interval will depend on\n  the project and the protocol. For comparability of the data, repeat surveys\n  should be undertaken at the same time(s) of year, moon phase and during\n  similar weather conditions. If the conditions are unsuitable, the sampling\n  period is rescheduled or if this is not possible, any deviations in the\n  sampling conditions are recorded.\n</p>\n<p>\n  All invertebrate catch is preserved (for each trap and each trapping period)\n  and stored for future analysis, generally as bulk, mixed samples (reflecting\n  how they were collected in the field) until identification is required,\n  available or affordable. Samples can be sorted (e.g. into RTU’s and\n  life-stages). Specimen identification and DNA analysis will require expert\n  input. The Invertebrate fauna module is linked to the following modules:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Plot selection and layout – before commencing the Invertebrate fauna\n      module, the Plot selection and layout module must be completed to mark out\n      the fauna plot with high accuracy using the Trimble® R1.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Soils – the soil samples collected for the Soils module provide the\n      opportunity to detect invertebrate fauna through eDNA.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Vertebrate fauna – invertebrates may be opportunistically collected in\n      vertebrate fauna traps. The selection of vertebrate fauna protocols (full\n      or lite) may dictate the selection of micro-pitfall trapping protocol\n      (full or lite). The timing of invertebrate sampling will need to consider\n      any impacts on vertebrate fauna trapping (e.g. light trapping could\n      influence vertebrate fauna trap results).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Targeted survey – the results of the Invertebrate fauna module sampling\n      may be a trigger for targeted survey. If biosecurity (i.e. monitoring for\n      potential incursion of exotic pests) is a specific focus, sampling methods\n      outside of those listed in the Invertebrate fauna module may be more\n      appropriate to enable rapid detection of taxa – use the Targeted Survey\n      module in such instances.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Opportune – invertebrates can also be collected opportunistically (within\n      and outside the plot) as part of the Opportunistic observations module.\n      The opportunity for opportunistic sampling of invertebrates may occur\n      during systematic sampling.

A\n      pre-requisite when establishing the fauna plot is that the vegetation\n      association is homogeneous and matches that within the adjoining\n      vegetation and soils plot.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For baseline inventory, plots are chosen to cover the major vegetation\n      associations present within a project area, providing spatial coverage\n      across the project area, and focusing on areas that represent the most\n      natural (undisturbed) conditions. For ongoing monitoring, plot selection\n      will depend on the question/s being asked and the impact footprint, and\n      may include a range of conditions and treatments (e.g. design) (Hoekman et\n      al. 2017).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Terrestrial invertebrate communities that are dependent on or restricted\n      to specific vegetation or habitat types (e.g. SREs) are likely to be most\n      impacted by ecosystem change (Houghton et al. 2019). Ecotones (i.e. where\n      ecosystems converge) and riparian zones are productive areas for\n      collecting invertebrates (Upton et al. 2010), but are not covered by the\n      plot based approach. For these reasons, targeted (outside of plot)\n      invertebrate survey may be important to supplement the plot-based results.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Permits</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      There are no specific permit requirements for collecting terrestrial\n      invertebrates in Australia, unless they are a listed species at a state or\n      Commonwealth level. A scientific permit is required if undertaking work in\n      a protected area. Special permit requirements may apply on offshore\n      islands (e.g. Lord Howe Island, Christmas Island and Macquarie Island)\n      because of their natural heritage value. Permits may also be required if\n      the sampling method poses a risk to vertebrate fauna. Refer to the\n      relevant authority in the relevant State or Territory (Upton et al. 2010).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The survey coordinator must check that all scientific permit and animal\n      ethics requirements are being met.

For\n      instructions on how to operate the Trimble® R1 refer to the General\n      Introduction Chapter. The guidelines below are relevant to all\n      invertebrate fauna protocols.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The specific invertebrate collecting equipment identified in this module\n      must be used to standardise the results. Most of the equipment can be\n      sourced from Australian Entomological Supplies (online). The relevant\n      state/local environmental authority may have equipment available for hire.\n      Refer to each of the protocols below for a list of the equipment required.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Trimble® R1 is the preferred method for recording the location of\n      invertebrate sampling, as this provides a high level of accuracy that is\n      important for repeat monitoring.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      DAWE and TERN have no affiliation with any of the suppliers listed. Where\n      a specific supplier is noted, this is simply for convenience, and\n      alternatives can be sourced. For a list of entomological suppliers, refer\n      to (Upton et al. 2010) (p75).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The permit conditions in some jurisdictions require fauna survey equipment\n      that is used to capture animals to be clearly labelled (e.g., organisation\n      name, contact number and/or permit number). Check your permit conditions\n      for any details that may be required.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      It is important to clean equipment thoroughly when collecting samples for\n      DNA analysis.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Traps/survey equipment must be removed at the completion of a survey\n      event.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Safety</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Users should avoid working in the field alone and should carry portable\n      communication devices (mobiles, UHF radios), especially when working in\n      remote areas.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Chemicals are used for killing and preserving invertebrates, notably ethyl\n      acetate, ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and propylene glycol.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Ethanol and ethyl acetate are highly flammable (both in liquid and vapour\n      form). Ethanol is a mild poison (made by distillation with benzene which\n      causes cancer, not suitability for human consumption). Breathing vapours\n      of ethyl acetate may cause drowsiness and dizziness, and irritate the\n      eyes, throat and skin. Repeated contact causes defatting of the skin with\n      irritation, dryness, and cracking, and can be seriously damaging to\n      internal organs in the case of prolonged exposure.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Propylene glycol (antifreeze) is generally regarded as safe (not suitable\n      for human consumption but environmentally non-toxic). It can be safely\n      disposed of on soil or in water, although check the disposal requirements\n      as they may vary between jurisdictions. Do not use ethylene glycol\n      antifreeze as it is poisonous, toxic and requires disposal at a licenced\n      facility.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      MSDS must be printed and stored with any chemicals, and strict safety\n      protocols followed. Permits may be required regarding their use and\n      transport.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weather</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The suitability of the weather conditions for the invertebrate sampling\n      methods should be assessed prior to a field trip. Adjustments may be\n      necessary to the trip dates or survey days within the trip.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      If possible, an onsite automatic weather station should be installed for\n      the duration of a sampling event, to record daily temperatures, rainfall\n      and humidity. A weather station is established as part of the Vertebrate\n      fauna module (full protocol). For invertebrate survey, the weather station\n      is ideally placed near the ground surface within the fauna plot.\n      Otherwise, data should be obtained from the nearest weather station.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Categorical weather data (drop-down selections for wind, rain,\n      temperature, sun/cloud) is also recorded for each protocol. The data\n      fields will be pre-filled if weather data has already been recorded for\n      the day, with the option to update the entries to match the prevailing\n      conditions.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sampling, preservation, identification and storage</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      It is helpful to be familiar with the common invertebrate orders before\n      conducting surveys. There are a number of useful web resources available,\n      such as:\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>http://anic.ento.csiro.au/insectfamilies/</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/bugwise/</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        A list of useful books and identification keys is provided in Upton et\n        al. (2010).\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Experience visually identifying invertebrates in the field is not\n      essential for this module as all captures are collected for later\n      identification, either based on morphology or via DNA analysis. This means\n      it is of utmost importance that the samples are appropriately stored.\n      Preservation and storage requirements are summarized in Section 10.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Liaise with the receiving museum or relevant institution prior to\n      commencing this module, to discuss:\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>specific collection, preservation and storage requirements</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>\n        the availability and cost of taxonomic identification and genetic\n        expertise\n      </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>options for long-term storage.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Ethyl acetate is used as standard euthanising chemical in the field, for\n      active survey methods or where specimens are dry collected. For\n      instructions on how to make a kill jar, refer to Upton et al. (2010).\n      Freezing is the most humane method of killing insects if this option is\n      available. Some taxa (e.g. moths and butterflies) are best kept alive and\n      put in a freezer as soon as practical after trapping to preserve their\n      condition (Sherley and Evans 2016).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Appropriate preservation and storage of samples is of utmost importance to\n      ensure their future value. High grade (95% and above) ethanol and\n      undiluted propylene glycol are adopted as the standard preservative\n      solutions, for a killing agent through to long-term storage, based on\n      their DNA preservability, low toxicity, availability and cost (Nakamura et\n      al. 2020). Ethanol is the traditional killing agent of choice however\n      ppropylene glycol has the benefit of being less likely to evaporate in the\n      field, less flammable, odourless, cheaper, and easier to transport.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>RNAlater® is another preservative option that can be explored.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Trapping results can differ significant depending on the killing agent\n      used (Gossner et al. 2016). The relative influence of the preservatives on\n      captures is unknown, however the potential for related bias is true for\n      any preservative that is used (Skvarla et al. 2014). Given propylene\n      glycol is odourless it may be a better option as a killing agent in traps,\n      however this remains untested.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Samples should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight and heat in the field\n      as they can degrade, ethanol can evaporate, and propylene glycol can\n      decompose into water, acetone and isopropanol. The effects generally lead\n      to lower DNA integrity (Weigand et al. 2021). Samples can be kept in a\n      cooler or refrigerator if available.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Timing</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The timing of repeat invertebrate surveys should be standardised as much\n      as possible to reduce the effect of environmental factors and seasonal\n      variability on the results. Ideally, sampling is undertaken during the\n      same time period, the same moon phase, and the same (as much as possible)\n      weather conditions, for the same duration each sampling event.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Invertebrate sampling is ideally undertaken during the same period as\n      vertebrate fauna surveys, so trends can be assessed, and co-timed with the\n      vegetation and soil monitoring, so the results can be analysed with\n      respect to available plant and litter resources in the local landscape.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Timing of surveys for conservation significant and short range endemic\n      invertebrate fauna should follow also follow existing guidelines (EPA\n      2016; Australian Government Department of Agriculture Water and the\n      Environment 2021).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The time of day can be important. Early mornings can be productive as\n      insects are actively feeding as the day warms up. Insect activity\n      typically declines in hot weather (Upton et al. 2010).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Invertebrates can respond to change quicker than plants and animals, and\n      their presence and movements strongly linked to phenological events, so\n      intra-annual sampling covering a range of temporal and meteorological\n      conditions will provide more comprehensive results (Battelle 2020; Grange\n      et al. 2021).\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Analysis</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      The approach and expertise required to statistically analyse collected\n      data and interpret DNA analyses should be determined at the start of a\n      project and factored into the costs.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reporting</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Reporting on the survey results may be a requirement of scientific permits\n      and animal ethics approval.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      Any vertebrate fauna by-catch/trap deaths must be documented. Ensure the\n      trap type, date, time, species and any comments relevant to the cause are\n      recorded. This information will be required for animal ethics and\n      scientific permit report returns, as well as any specific reporting\n      mechanisms required by the relevant jurisdiction.
