JAXB RI 2.2.11, included here to get a version of xjc that
fixes https://java.net/jira/browse/JAXB-973

With this version, generated Javadoc does not include
literal greater-than signs, and so passes the doclint
tests included during Javadoc generation under JDK 8.

Available at: https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.11/
Included in this repository under the CDDL.
