# Special rewriting for SPARQL endpoint and SISSVoc URLs with "_current"
# as the version component.

# Please note: if you are making use of virtual hosts -- and you
# almost certainly are, at least for port 443 -- you _must_
# also insert these two lines into _each_ virtual host you want
# to work (and then uncomment them!).
# For example, you typically will want to insert it
# into _both_ the virtual host for port 80 (if defined in conf/httpd.conf)
# _and_ the virtual host for port 443 (defined in conf.d/ssl.conf).
# Basically, if the rewriting doesn't work, you probably need to add
# these two lines within each virtual host definition!
